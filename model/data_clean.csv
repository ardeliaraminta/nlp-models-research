"As more patients choose dental implants as their primary treatment option to restore edentulous ridges or to replace compromised dentition, preventive strategies for peri-implant diseases and complications have become an important topic.
The aim of the review article is to summarize the current available evidence on the potential risk factors/indicators for peri-implant disease development and then focus on the preventive strategies for peri-implant diseases and conditions.
After reviewing the diagnostic criteria and the etiology of peri-implant diseases and conditions, evidence on the possible associated risk factors/indicators for peri-implant diseases were searched and identified. Recent studies were also surveyed to explore the preventive measures for peri-implant diseases.
The possible associated risk factors of peri-implant diseases can be divided into the following categories: patient-specific factors, implant-specific factors, and long-term factors. Patient-specific factors such as history of periodontitis and smoking have been conclusively associated with peri-implant diseases, whereas findings on others, such as diabetes and genetic factors, remain inconclusive. It has been suggested that both implant-specific factors, such as implant position, soft tissue characteristics, and the type of connection used, and long-term factors, such as poor plaque control and a lack of maintenance program, have a strong impact on maintaining the health of a dental implant. Assessment tool for evaluating the risk factors can be a potential preventive measure for peri-implant disease prediction, and it is needed to be properly validated.
Proper maintenance program for early intervention to control peri-implant diseases at the initial stage and pretreatment assessment of the potential risk factors is the best strategy to prevent implant diseases.",0
"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a recognized risk factor for dementia, and increasing evidence shows that tooth loss is associated with cognitive impairment and dementia. However, the effect of the co-occurrence of DM and edentulism on cognitive decline is understudied. This 12-y cohort study aimed to assess the effect of the co-occurrence of DM and edentulism on cognitive decline and examine whether the effect differs by age group. Data were drawn from the 2006 to 2018 Health and Retirement Study. The study sample included 5,440 older adults aged 65 to 74 y, 3,300 aged 75 to 84 y, and 1,208 aged 85 y or older. Linear mixed-effect regression was employed to model the rates of cognitive decline stratified by age cohorts. Compared with their counterparts with neither DM nor edentulism at baseline, older adults aged 65 to 74 y (β = -1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.56 to -0.65; ",0
"Risk factors associated with tooth loss have been studied; however, the current status of the epidemiological profiles and the impact of the pandemic on the oral health of the elderly is still unknown. This study aims to determine the experience of caries and tooth loss among elderly Chilean citizens in five regions and to identify the risk factors associated with tooth loss. The sample includes 135 participants over 60 years old assessed during COVID-19 lockdown. Sociodemographic variables such as education and RSH (Social Registry of Households) were obtained through a teledentistry platform called TEGO. The history of chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, depression and dental caries reported by DMFT index scores were incorporated. The statistical analysis included Adjusted Odds Ratios (ORs) to assess risk factors associated with the lack of functional dentition. Multivariate hypothesis testing was used to compare the mean equality of DMFT and its components between regions (",0
"To retrospectively assess clinical and radiographic outcomes of immediately loaded full-arch fixed prostheses supported by axial and tilted implants up to 15 years of function.
Patients with one completely edentulous arch received an immediate full-arch fixed prosthesis supported by two anterior axial and two posterior tilted implants. Definitive prosthesis consisting of a CAD-CAM titanium framework and acrylic teeth was delivered 6 months later. Patients were regularly followed to assess clinical parameters and marginal bone level (MBL) change. Multilevel regression analysis was performed to investigate factors affecting implant failure and MBL.
Six hundred ninety-two implants were placed in 72 maxillae and 101 mandibles. Seven maxillary implants (5 axial and 2 tilted) in 6 patients and 12 mandibular implants (6 axial and 6 tilted) in 5 patients failed. 15-year cumulative implant survival was 97.51% and 96.91% in maxilla and mandible, respectively (p = .64). After 10 years, the difference in MBL between axial and tilted implants was not significant in the maxilla (p = .47, 65 patients), while it was in the mandible (p < .001, 80 patients). Significant higher bone loss was reported in the mandible at both 5- and 10-year follow-up (p < .001 and p = .004, respectively). Mixed-effect multilevel linear regression evidenced a correlation between arch and bone loss at 5- and 10-year follow-up, while no correlation was found with age, gender, smoking, diabetes, and history of periodontal disease.
This long-term study suggests that the present technique can be considered a viable treatment modality for the immediate rehabilitation of both maxilla and mandible.",0
"Periodontal disease often develops in patients with diabetes, and further exacerbated with diabetic complications. It would be clinically important to clarify the relationship between diabetic microvascular diseases and periodontal disease. This study aimed to evaluate the association between periodontal disease and diabetic complications in patients with type 2 diabetes with poor glycemic control. A total of 447 patients with type 2 diabetes hospitalized at Rakuwakai Otowa Hospital, Japan, were initially recruited in this study. After excluding 134 patients who lacked clinical data or were edentulous, 312 were included in our study. The severity of periodontal disease was evaluated based on the average bone resorption rate. Patients with diabetic nephropathy developed severe periodontal disease (multivariate-adjusted odds ratio, 3.00 [95% CI 1.41-5.19]). Diabetic neuropathy was positively associated with the severity of periodontal disease; the multivariate-adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) was 1.62 (0.87‒2.99) for moderate and 4.26 (2.21‒8.20) for severe periodontal disease. In contrast, diabetic retinopathy was linked with moderate periodontal disease (multivariate-adjusted odds ratio 2.23 [95% CI 1.10-4.10]), but not with severe conditions (multivariate-adjusted odds ratio 0.92 [95% CI 0.67-3.07]). In conclusion, periodontal disease, evaluated by average bone resorption rate, was associated with diabetic nephropathy and neuropathy.

"The objective of the present study was to compare the prevalence of edentulism in Mexican adults with and without a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) when they are seeking dental care. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1921 medical records of Mexican adults 40 years of age and older who sought dental care at clinics of a public university in Mexico. The dependent variable was edentulism, clinically determined through an oral examination. The main independent variable was the self-report of previous T2DM diagnosis made by a physician. Sociodemographic, socioeconomic and behavioral covariates were included in a multivariate binary logistic regression model. Overall edentulism prevalence was 8.4% (95% CI = 7.1-9.6). The prevalence of T2DM was 14.3% (n = 274). The prevalence of edentulism among individuals with T2DM was 13.1%, but only 7.6% among individuals without T2DM. In the multivariate binary logistic regression model, a previous T2DM diagnosis increased the probability of being edentulous 1.61 times (95% CI = 1.03-2.50). For each year a person's age increased, the likelihood of being edentulous increased by 12% (95% CI = 10-14%). In summary, a higher prevalence of edentulism was present in Mexican adults with T2DM and in those of older age. This information may be used by dental care providers and health policymakers to improve approaches to preventive care, as well as to characterize and anticipate care needs more accurately for the adult and older adult populations.",0
"The purpose of this work is to analyze the effects of removable dental prostheses and aging on blood microcirculation in the palatal mucosa.
Blood flow was measured in two groups using the Laser Doppler Flowmeter at three specific anatomical sites: Retro incisive papilla, medial raphe, and Schroeder area.
Group 1 included young, healthy dentulous individuals (mean age: 23 ± 3 years), and Group 2 contained elderly edentulous individuals (mean age: 62 ± 11.69 years). For Group 1, measurements were taken in a single session; for Group 2, the measurements were taken in two sessions: The first just before the prosthetic load (E1) and again 1 week after new dentures were provider (E2).
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software, Version 9.4 of the SAS System for Windows, Copyright © 2017 SAS Institute Inc. (Cary, NC, USA). A P < 0.05 was classified as statistically significant.
Measurements of blood flow of the palatal mucosa showed that the healthy young dentulous participants had significantly lower perfusion unit values than the elderly edentulous participants at all three anatomical sites (P < 0.05). For Group 2, the comparisons between the measurements taken before (E1) and after (E2) new dentures were provided showed no significant differences.
Our results indicate that the process of aging significantly modifies the blood flow of the palatal mucosa while wearing removable dental prostheses does not modify the blood flow of the palatal mucosa in a 1week period. These results are not influenced by systemic pathology (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular diseases) or smoking.",0
"To evaluate the benefits of implant therapy for patients with diabetes, we compared (i) healthy, (ii) well controlled T2DM and (iii) poorly controlled T2DM patients, in terms of oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and satisfaction with mandibular 2-implant overdentures over 12 months following restoration.
This single-center, prospective, cohort study recruited 165 edentulous adults (HbA1c<12%) to receive two endosseous implants in the anterior mandible to support mandibular overdentures. Participants were enrolled as having T2DM or not, with T2DM participants divided according to HbA1c into well-controlled (<8.1%) and poorly controlled (≥ 8.1%) groups. Participants provided responses to the OHIP-20 (OHRQoL) and the McGill Denture Satisfaction Questionnaire, before implant therapy and 6 and 12 months after overdenture insertion using Locator attachments. HbA1c was measured at the same time points. The effect of groups and time was verified using generalized estimating equations (α=0.025).
At 12 months, 137 participants provided responses. The two diabetes groups showed improvements in OHRQoL to the same extent as the non-diabetic control group at both 6 and 12 months. Patient satisfaction showed similar improvements with no between-group differences and similar increases identified at 6 and 12 months. HbA1c was not affected by time or groups.
Dental implant therapy provided significant improvements in patient-perceived benefits of mandibular two-implant overdentures for T2DM individuals, which are similar to those found for healthy edentulous individuals. Importantly, those benefits extend to those individuals with poorly controlled glycaemia. The addition of 2-implant supported mandibular overdentures did not affect glycaemic status over 12 months following insertion.
As risks for implant therapy relative to glycaemic status are better understood, this study documents that implant therapy may offer important benefits in QoL for T2DM patients independent of glycaemic status.",0
"The aim of this retrospective clinical study was to evaluate and compare implant survival, marginal bone loss, and clinical and prosthetic complications in healthy patients and patients with type I diabetes undergoing full arch implant-prosthetic rehabilitation. A total of 47 patients needing total fixed rehabilitation of one or both arches were enrolled for this study. Based on the absence of any systemic diseases (Group A) or the presence of type I diabetes (Group B), the sample was divided into two groups. According to the grade of bone atrophy in the posterior region, patients received full arch rehabilitation (of one or both jaws) with 6 axial implants or, if the residual posterior bone height was insufficient, All-on-Four rehabilitation and a total 236 dental implants were placed. Follow-up visits were performed 1 week after surgery, at 3 and 6 months and then once a year for the next 10 years. No statistically significant differences between groups were recorded about implant survival rates, marginal bone loss, or clinical and prosthetic complications. However, concerning complications, post-surgical bleeding and wound infection were recorded in Group A more than in Group B. In cases of compensated diabetes compensation, implant placement could be considered a safe procedure.",0
"Introduction The main purpose of the study was to assess and compare bone mineral density (BMD) at prospective implant sites in the mandible in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and non-diabetic patients using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). Material and methodology A total of 40 patients were included in this type of cross-sectional study. They were divided into two groups, A and B, according to their haemoglobin A1c values. Group A consisted of patients with HbA1c between the range of 6.1%-8% and group B had patients with no history of T2DM. CBCT scans were made of the mandibular arches of both the patients to evaluate the BMD at lingual and buccal cortical plates and the trabecular regions in two successive slices with the assistance of PlanMeca Romexis software (PlanMeca Romexis®, Helsinki, Finland). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine the normality of continuous data. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the groups. Results There were no differences that were statistically significant between the two cohorts according to the Mann-Whitney U test at buccal cortical plate points 1 and 2. However, the diabetes group's mean bone density at implant sites-A, B, C, D, and E at trabeculae points 1 and 2 was considerably (7p>0.001) lower than the non-diabetic groups. The mean bone density of the diabetes group was marginally but significantly (p=0.009) lower than the non-diabetic group at lingual cortical plates. Conclusion Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus show significantly lower bone mineral density in the lingual cortical plate and trabecular region, however, implant therapy can be performed with certain mentioned guidelines in such regions. In the buccal cortical region, the bone mineral density is seen to be unaffected.",0
"Dental caries is the most prevalent dental disease affecting human race. The etiology and pathogenesis of dental caries are known to be multifactorial. Studies have shown that removable partial dentures in the oral cavity increases the biofilm formation and consequently an increase in the occurrence of caries and periodontal diseases. There is a complex relationship between diabetes mellitus and dental caries. Patients with diabetes are more susceptible to oral sensory, periodontal, and salivary disorders which could increase the risk of developing new and recurrent dental caries. Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of dental caries among diabetic and non-diabetic acrylic removable partial denture wearers.
Individuals participating in the study were partially edentulous and aged between 18 and 64 years. Patients were screened at Out patient department (OPD) in the Department of Prosthodontics JSSDCH, among which 60 patients were diabetic based on the random blood sugar level more than 160 mg/dl-30 patients were wearing RPD and 30 were without RPD. And 60 non-diabetic patients were selected among which 30 were wearing RPD and 30 without RPD. A total 120 patients were screened. Dental caries prevalence was assessed using Decayed, Missing, Filled (DMFT) index.
Diabetic group unrehabilitated with removable partial prosthesis showed significant difference in the number of missing teeth when compared to non-diabetic patients without removable prosthesis (
Removable partial denture prosthesis had less impact on prevalence of dental caries with good oral hygiene, following post insertion RPD instructions and regular dental visits irrespective of diabetes.",0
"An increasing number of elderly people retain their natural teeth into old age and further, the prevalence of endosseous implants for supporting oral prosthesis is ever increasing. These teeth and implants now present a considerable challenge in terms of maintenance, especially when patients become dependent on care. Periodontal and peri-implant diseases are more prevalent in elderly than in younger age cohorts. There are distinct differences related to the inflammatory response between periodontal and peri-implant tissues, both in young and old age. The age-related reasons for the increase in periodontal infections may be related to poor oral hygiene because of a loss of dexterity or vision, but also to immunosenescence. This term describes the aging of the immune system and the decline of its effectiveness with age. Low-grade infections, like chronic periodontitis, may cause low-grade inflammation and subsequently increase the likelihood of developing chronic diseases. In return, treatment of periodontitis may improve general health, as demonstrated for diabetes. A second mechanism illustrating how poor oral health translates into systemic disease is the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. The treatment options in old age should be evaluated with regard to the issues of general health and maintenance. Systematic periodontal maintenance therapy, as performed in younger age cohorts, may be difficult to implement in elderly people experiencing institutional or hospital confinement because of logistics, barriers related to patients and caregivers, or cost. The scale of periodontal disease in old age represents a public health issue.",0
"A new tissue-level implant design with angulations of 17, 30, and 45 degrees has been introduced to allow the use of the existing bone while maintaining the restorative platform at an angle to ensure an optimal functional and esthetic result for treatment of edentulous patients. The aim of this study was to measure implant survival, bone loss, and peri-implant health of the novel tissue-level angled-head dental implant system.
A retrospective analysis of cases from three private offices that were using the new implant system was performed. Data regarding patients' demographics, number and location of implants, restoration type, bone loss, implant failure, bleeding, and pocket depths were collected and analyzed. The data collected were analyzed using mainly descriptive statistics.
A total of 29 participants were selected, and 185 dental implants were placed. The average patient age was 61 ± 7 years, and 52% were female. Some of the patients were medically compromised; 7% were diabetic, 20% were smokers, and 7% had osteoporosis. The average time from dental implant placement to the placement of the screw-retained crowns was 6 ± 5 months. Four implants failed with an average time to failure of 18 ± 8 months. Implant survival rate was 97.8%. The average bone loss was 0.014 ± 0.082 mm at 1 year, 0.133 ± 0.306 mm at 5 years, and 0.426 ± 0.903 mm at 10 years. Overall, 18.9% of implants were associated with bleeding, and only one implant had a pocket depth greater than or equal to 5 mm.
The new tissue-level implant design with angulations of 17, 30, and 45 degrees has demonstrated predictable survival and success rates with minimal bone loss. The long-term follow-up seems highly promising; however, further studies are warranted to validate the results.",0
"Phthalates exposure and complete edentulism are related to both low socioeconomic status. No study by far has verified if and to what extent these two conditions are related. We aimed to explore their potential association and interplay in the metabolic control and cardiovascular risk profile.
In our small (n = 48) prospective pilot study twenty-four patients with type 2 diabetes (DnE) and twenty-four patients with type 2 diabetes and edentulism (DE) followed for 19 ± 2 months were treated according to best clinical standards. Phthalates' exposure was evaluated by urinary concentration of di-2-ethylhexylphthalate (DEHP), metabolites, i.e. mono 2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate (MEOHP) and mono 2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate (MEHHP).
No association between phthalates and edentulism was found, nor did edentulism affect glucose control. Higher phthalates exposure was associated with a glycated haemoglobin worsening. This association was found for all the measured phthalates metabolites, both as a whole (DEHP; r = 0.33, p = 0.0209) and individually: MEHP (r = 0.41, p = 0.0033), MEHHP (r = 0.32, p = 0.028), MEOHP (r = 0.28, p = 0.0386).
Phthalates are not associated with edentulism but predict the worsening of glucose control in subjects with type 2 diabetes. These findings might prove relevant in identifying novel biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk. Further studies are needed to validate our results and estimate the true potential of phthalates in terms of risk assessment.",0
"Half of US adults aged 20-64 years have lost at least one permanent tooth; one in six adults aged 65 and over in the USA is edentulous. Tooth loss and edentulism interfere with nutritional intake and quality of life. Although selected chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes) have been identified as possible risk factors for tooth loss, data on multiple chronic diseases and on having two or more concurrent chronic diseases (multimorbidity) in relation to tooth loss are lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the association between multiple chronic diseases, multimorbidity, and tooth loss in US adults.
We performed a secondary data analysis using the US 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a national cross-sectional telephone survey studying health conditions and health behaviors among US adults (≥18 years) who are non-institutionalized residents. Variables were derived from the BRFSS Standard Core Questionnaire. Descriptive analysis including means, standard deviations (SDs), and percentages was calculated. Sample weights were applied. The stepwise multinomial logistic regression method was used to examine the relationship between several chronic diseases and tooth loss. Separate multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between multimorbidity and tooth loss among all adults aged more than 18 years, adults aged 18-64 years, and adults aged more than 65 years, respectively.
Among the samples (
Multiple chronic diseases were associated with edentulism and tooth loss. People with multimorbidity are more likely to be edentulous than those with one or no chronic disease. The findings from this study will help to identify populations at increased risk for oral problems and nutritional deficits, thus the assessment of oral health should be evaluated further as an important component of chronic illness care.",0
"According to recent scientific consensus, there is an increasing amount of evidence on the correlation between oral health and cardiovascular disease morbidity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the number of missing teeth, the presence of residual roots with necrotic pulp and teeth with caries, the type of teeth deficiencies, and periodontal status in patients after myocardial infarction (MI). A total of 151 patients after MI and 160 randomly selected controls without history of MI were enrolled in the study. Epidemiological data were collected, and dental examination was performed. Findings showed significantly more women, subjects with lower level of education, lower income, higher percentage of nicotine addiction, more frequent presence of arterial hypertension, diabetes, and obesity than in the study group. Moreover, oral status of the subjects who suffered from MI was inferior to the control group. An average patient from the study group had 11 missing teeth, when compared to four missing teeth in an average control subject (p < 0.0001). The majority of patients in the control group had occlusal contacts in intercuspal position in premolars and molars (group A), in contrast to the patients after MI, who had at least one missing supporting zone (group B) (p < 0.0001). Severe periodontitis was found in 50.3% of tests and in 30.4% of controls (p < 0.0001). A correlation was found between the edentulousness and the risk of myocardial infarction after adjusting for other known risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (OR = 3.8; 95% CI = 3.01−7.21; p < 0.0001). This case−control study showed that MI patients had more missing teeth, more residual roots with necrotic pulp, much higher incidence of edentulism and occlusal contacts in intercuspal position in fewer than four occlusal supporting zones, as well as worse periodontal status when compared to healthy subjects without a history of MI. Due to the methodology of unmatched controls, the presented results must be interpreted with caution.",0
"Background: Dietary habits, food intake and oral health are important factors for general health. The aim of these present study was to assess the association between implant-supported fixed oral rehabilitation and glycemia, by monitoring HbA1c values before and after implant-supported prostheses (ISP) delivery to diabetic individuals. Methods: Retrospective, cohort study based on dental records. All treatments were performed by experienced oral and maxillofacial surgeons and experienced prosthodontists. Inclusion criteria: ISP delivery, diagnosis of diabetes in the medical files, consecutive individuals. Variables included—primary outcome—differences (delta) in HbA1c values prior to implant placement and one year after ISP delivery, early implant failure (EIF). Confounding factors included age, gender, physical status, smoking, implant jaw location, implant length, implant width, total implant count per individual. Results: Statistically significant (p < 0.01) decrease in HbA1c from 7.10 ± 1.09% to 6.66 ± 1.02% following ISP delivery was recorded. The mean HbA1c delta was 0.44 ± 0.73%, where 39.0% of the patients had a significant improvement (delta decrease > 0.5%). Univariate and multivariate model using logistic regression at individual level showed that initial high HbA1c levels was the only factor positively predicting improvement (OR = 1.96, CI [1.22, 3.14], p < 0.01). Univariate model at implant level demonstrated that implants placed in the anterior maxilla also contributed to significant improvement in HbA1c values. Multivariate analysis at implant level was similar to individual level. Number of missing teeth did not affect the results significantly. Conclusion: ISP delivery to partially or completely edentulous diabetic individuals may improve HbA1c balance. The mechanism awaits future elucidation.",0
"The aim of this prospective case-control study was to compare the development of implant stability quotients of narrow diameter implants in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and healthy individuals within the first 3 months after implant insertion.
Sixteen patients with T2DM (HbA1C > 6.5%) as test group and 16 nondiabetic patients (HbA1C < 5.9%) as the control group were evaluated. All patients received narrow-diameter tissue level implants in an edentulous area posterior to the canine. The implant stability was measured by means of resonance frequency analysis after 3 days, 7 days, 4 weeks, and 3 months postplacement. Statistical analysis of intergroup differences and correlation to HbA1c values and treated jaw was performed in PRISM 8.
The means for implant stability quotients showed a significant increase between Day 3 and 3-month assessment in both groups. No significant differences between study groups and no correlation of implant stability to HbA1c were found.
The present study shows encouraging clinical outcomes for narrow-diameter implants inserted in the posterior zone in patients with uncontrolled T2DM.",0
"Little is known about the association between multimorbidity (i.e., two or more chronic conditions) and sleep problems in the general adult populations of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Thus, we aimed to assess this association among adults from 46 LMICs, and to quantify the extent to which anxiety, depression, stress, and pain explain this association.
Cross-sectional, predominantly nationally representative, community-based data from the World Health Survey were analyzed. Nine chronic physical conditions (angina, arthritis, asthma, chronic back pain, diabetes, edentulism, hearing problems, tuberculosis, visual impairment) were assessed. To be included in the analysis, sleep problems had to have been experienced in the past 30 days and to have been severe or extreme; they included difficulties falling asleep, waking up frequently during the night or waking up too early in the morning. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analyses were conducted to explore the associations.
Data on 237,023 individuals aged ≥18 years [mean (SD) age 38.4 (16.0) years; 49.2% men] were analyzed. Compared with no chronic conditions, having 1, 2, 3, and ≥4 conditions was associated with 2.39 (95%CI=2.14, 2.66), 4.13 (95%CI=3.62, 4.71), 5.70 (95%CI=4.86, 6.69), and 9.99 (95%CI=8.18, 12.19) times higher odds for sleep problems. Pain (24.0%) explained the largest proportion of the association between multimorbidity and sleep problems, followed by anxiety (21.0%), depression (11.2%), and stress (10.4%).
Multimorbidity was associated with a substantially increased odds for sleep problems in adults from 46 LMICs. Future studies should assess whether addressing factors such as pain, anxiety, depression, and stress in people with multimorbidity can lead to improvement in sleep in this population.",0
"Horseshoe Le Fort I osteotomy (HLFO) in combination with iliac bone grafts interposition is an established and very effective procedure for reconstructing the severely atrophic maxilla. However potential complications connected to this method, such as oronasal fistula (ONF), have not been described in the literature to date.
We report the case of a female patient with severe atrophy of the edentulous maxillary alveolar ridge with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Initially, a sinus floor augmentation was performed, followed by a failed placement of dental implants. Afterwards, HLFO with simultaneous interposition of iliac bone grafts was conducted. Subsequently, an oronasal communication occurred in the antral maxilla. As several local flaps had not achieved sufficient results, a melolabial interpolated island flap was carried out, yielding satisfactory results.
Failed implant treatment or bone augmentation procedures in combination with T2D may have resulted in significant tissue irritation and subsequent wound healing complications in the antral maxilla, leading to an ONF.
In this case, an ONF occurring after HLFO was described for the first time. The melolabial interpolated island flap proved to be an outstanding long-term solution for the management of an anterior ONF occurring after HLFO over a period of 10 years. Less invasive treatment options including zygomatic implants should be taken into consideration for the treatment of such patients.",0
"This study aimed to evaluate the associations of self-reported diabetic status with clinically assessed dental end points, including teeth with untreated coronal and root caries, missing teeth, complete tooth retention, edentulism and routine dental services utilization among adults aged ≥20 years in the United States.
We pooled data from the 2015-2016 and 2017-2018 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative, cross-sectional, continuous survey of noninstitutionalized US population. The analysed data included all adult participants aged ≥20 years who completed the dental examination and reported their diabetic status. We estimated the prevalence and average outcomes of dental end points by diabetic status. Regression analyses were employed to evaluate the associations between diabetic status and dental outcomes.
Of 10,249 participants, 1,562 reported having diabetes mellitus, which translates to 11.3% of US adults aged ≥20 years (25.7 million). Compared to non-diabetic individuals, adults with diabetes had 1.49 (95%CI = 1.1-2.0) and 1.46 (95%CI = 1.2-1.8) times higher odds of developing coronal and root caries respectively. Adults with diabetes were 32% less likely to be fully dentate (OR = 0.68; 95%CI = 0.55-0.83) and had a higher average number of missing teeth (mean ratio = 1.35; 95%CI = 1.18-1.55). There was no association between diabetic status and routine dental services utilization.
Adults with diabetes exhibited worse dental health; nonetheless, there was no difference in dental services utilization. Multidisciplinary efforts from both medical and dental service providers are required to proactively address the well-being of adults with diabetes in terms of oral health.",0
"The objective of this study was to analyze the association between tooth loss and uncontrolled diabetes among US adults.
The authors used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 2011 through 2018. The sample included 16,635 participants 20 years and older who represent 187,596,215 people in the United States in a probability weighted sample. The authors used bivariate analysis and multiple regressions to analyze factors associated with edentulism and number of missing teeth.
The multiple logistic regression model significantly predicted edentulism using diabetes status (adjusted odds ratio controlled diabetes, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.12 to 1.86]; adjusted odds ratio uncontrolled diabetes, 2.26 [95% CI, 1.33 to 3.85]), missing annual dental visits, seeing a dentist only for treatment, family income below 200% of the federal poverty guideline, being female, being 65 years or older, tobacco smoking, and no college education. After controlling for the same covariates, multiple Poisson regression analysis showed that dentate adults with controlled and uncontrolled diabetes had higher relative risk of tooth loss than those without diabetes (adjusted risk ratio controlled diabetes, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.35 to 1.71]; adjusted risk ratio uncontrolled diabetes, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.35 to 1.83]).
US adults with uncontrolled (glycated hemoglobin ≥ 9%) and controlled diabetes (glycated hemoglobin < 9%) were more likely to be edentulous and experience tooth loss than adults without diabetes.
US health policy officials should adopt benefits policies to provide regular dental examinations to people who have diabetes, have low income (< 200% of the federal poverty guideline), or are 65 years or older to reduce tooth loss and improve their quality of life. Dentists should work with physicians to help patients control glycemic levels.",0
"The aim of the study was to determine oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) using the measures Geriatric/General Oral Health Assessment (GOHAI) and Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) in relation to missing teeth in the Polish population aged 20-79. This was a cross-sectional study carried out among 1112 randomly selected participants. The mean age was 48.72 and mean number of teeth was 20.12. Altogether, in the GOHAI, the percentage that gave a positive response to each question ranged from 3.3% to 48.0%; in the OHIP-14, these answers ranged from 2.4% to 25.1%. The GOHAI measure was statistically significant, with more grouping variables than the OHIP-14 measure. Both measures showed significant associations with gender, age, dry mouth, education, professional status, number of teeth, and upper and lower total dentures. We detected a significant relationship between oral health-related quality of life and the factors influencing the presence or absence of dentition. Missing teeth were statistically associated with GOHAI, OHIP-14, advanced age, self-reported dry mouth, lower education, higher Body Mass Index (BMI), lower professional status, diabetes, myocardial infraction, and total dentures in upper or/and lower jaws. However, edentulous individuals had two times higher risk of having an OHIP-14 score above the median. This suggests that oral health practitioners should work to prevent oral diseases that lead to tooth loss in their patients, starting from an early age.",0
"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, aerosol-generating procedures, including dental implant treatments, are considered high-risk. With dental implant treatment mostly an elective procedure, we aimed to assess whether the pandemic influenced patient selection, surgical procedures, and postoperative complications. We compared dental implant treatments during (March to December 2020) and before (December 2018 to February 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic based on patient and implant parameters, as well as postoperative complications. For analysis, we used the Chi-squared test with the Holm-Sidak correction for multiple comparisons. The number of implants placed during the COVID-19 pandemic (696 implants in 406 patients, 70 implants per month) was comparable to pre-pandemic levels (1204 implants in 616 patients, 80 implants per month). Regarding patient parameters, there were no significant differences in respiratory (",0
"Oral mucosal lesions can be uncomfortable and can result in a poorer oral health related quality of life. This can be seen especially in edentulous patients who are mostly elderly and have comorbid diseases such as Diabetes Mellitus, which can impair their ability to withstand oral infections. In South Africa, one of the most unequal countries in the world, almost 50% of the population is edentulous and this prevalence increases as age increases. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the prevalence of denture-related stomatitis in subjects who presented to a tertiary institution in Cape Town, South Africa for new complete dentures and to determine the risk indicators associated with it. Three hundred and ninety-six folders of participants who received complete dentures during the period 2014-2019 were included in this study. Categorical data was displayed as frequencies and percentages and a multiple adjusted logistic regression was used to determine associations between Candida and certain risk indicators. The prevalence of denture-related stomatitis was 25.76% (",0
"Genetics plays a role in the susceptibility to periodontitis and tooth loss. Several studies examined the involvement of polymorphisms in candidate genes. We hypothesize that bone metabolism-related polymorphisms could be associated with the number of remaining teeth.
Participants in the Pro.V.A. longitudinal Study: 3099 Italians (aged 65+ at baseline), 2196 at follow-up 1 (5yrs), 1641 at follow-up 2 (7yrs) underwent detailed interview and clinical-instrumental examination. Subjects, grouped by remaining teeth number (0, 1-7, 8-19, 20+), were genotyped for six different bone-related polymorphisms: collagen type Iα1 (COL1A1, Sp1, 
COL1A1 associated with dental status: 
The present study, demonstrating an association between tooth loss and COL1A1 and -in men- CALCR, contributes to the identification of genes involved in tooth loss and, possibly, susceptibility to periodontitis.",0
"This study aimed to assess Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHQoL) and satisfaction in patients who had complete denture treatment and were diagnosed with systemic diseases. Eighty edentulous patients using new complete dentures were separated into four groups according to their diseases [diabetes mellitus (DM)/osteoporosis (OP)/hypertension (HP)/healthy (control)]. The groups answered the Turkish version of the United Kingdom-Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHQoL-UK) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) questionnaire four weeks after treatment. OHQoL-UK scores were slightly higher for females regardless of the type of disease. Compared with the control participants (57.95±5.33), the scores of the OHQoL-UK were not significantly different in OP and HP groups except for the DM group (58.7±5.37, 58.9±6.44, 45.3±5.19 respectively). DM was significantly associated with the increase of OHQoL values (p<0.05). Patients in all groups reported significantly higher ""physical health"" scores than other subdomains of OHQoL-UK, although positive correlations were determined among them. Presence of disease had no relationship to the VAS scores. This study shows that systemic diseases might not affect and predict patients' satisfaction with their complete dentures and OHQoL. DM is an independent risk factor for oral health. Satisfaction with the prosthesis might concern a patient's level of OHQoL.",0
"This study aimed to show the clinical outcomes of implants inserted by guided surgery supporting mandibular overdentures in edentulous patients.
Mandibular edentulous patients were diagnosed with an oral examination, cone-beam computerized tomography, and diagnostic casts for intermaxillary relations and treated with overdentures over two implants by guided surgery. After flapless surgery, implants were early loaded with an overdenture at 6 weeks.
Fourteen patients (nine females and five males) were treated with 28 implants. Four patients (28.6%) had a previous history of periodontitis. Five patients (35.7%) were smokers. Nine patients (64.3%) suffered from systemic diseases (i.e., diabetes, cardiovascular diseases). The clinical follow-up of the study was 44.7 ± 31.4 months. Clinical outcomes showed a global success of 100% of implants. Fourteen overdentures were placed in the patients over the implants. Mean marginal bone loss was 1.25 mm ± 0.95 mm. Four patients (28.6%) showed some kind of mechanical prosthodontic complications. Six implants (21.4%) were associated with peri-implantitis.
This study indicates that treatment of mandibular edentulous patients with overdentures by guided surgery and early loading of implants placed appears to be a successful implant protocol.",0
"Tooth loss has been shown to correlate with multiple systemic comorbidities. However, the associations between the number of remaining natural teeth (NoT) and all-cause mortality have not been explored extensively. We aimed to investigate whether having fewer NoT imposes a higher risk in mortality. We tested such hypotheses using three groups of NoT (20-28,10-19, and 0-9), edentulism and without functional dentition (NoT < 19).
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the United States (NHANES) (1999-2014) conducted dental examinations and provided linkage of mortality data. NHANES participants aged 20 years and older, without missing information of dental examination, age, gender, race, education, income, body-mass-index, smoking, physical activities, and existing systemic conditions [hypertension, total cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and stroke (N = 33,071; death = 3978), or with femoral neck bone mineral density measurement (N = 13,131; death = 1091)] were analyzed. Cox proportional hazard survival analyses were used to investigate risks of all-cause, heart disease, diabetes and cancer mortality associated with NoT in 3 groups, edentulism, or without functional dentition.
Participants having fewer number of teeth had higher all-cause and disease-specific mortality. In fully-adjusted models, participants with NoT0-9 had the highest hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality [HR(95%CI) = 1.46(1.25-1.71); p < .001], mortality from heart diseases [HR(95%CI) = 1.92(1.33-2.77); p < .001], from diabetes [HR(95%CI) = 1.67(1.05-2.66); p = 0.03], or cancer-related mortality [HR(95%CI) = 1.80(1.34-2.43); p < .001]. Risks for all-cause mortality were also higher among the edentulous [HR(95%CI) = 1.35(1.17-1.57); p < .001] or those without functional dentition [HR(95%CI) = 1.34(1.17-1.55); p < .001].
Having fewer NoT were associated with higher risks for all-cause mortality. More research is needed to explore possible biological implications and validate our findings.",0

"Previous studies on the diabetes-edentulism relationship have yielded conflicting results. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate the association between diabetes and edentulism, and their joint effects on health status in adults from 40 low and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Data from the World Health Survey were used for this cross-sectional study (2002-2004). Forty countries (18 low-income and 22 middle-income countries) were included. Edentulism and diabetes were assessed using yes-no questions based on self-report. Health status was assessed in seven different domains (self-care, pain/discomfort, cognition, interpersonal activities, sleep/energy, affect, and perceived stress). The association between diabetes (exposure) and edentulism (outcome) was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression models, while their joint effects on health status were assessed using multivariable linear regression models.
There were 175 814 adults aged ≥18 years included in this study (mean (SD) age 38.4 (16.0) years; 49.3% men). Overall, the prevalence of edentulism was 6.0% and diabetes was 2.9%. There was a positive and significant association between diabetes and edentulism in the overall sample (OR=1.40, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.66), in low-income countries (OR=1.78, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.62) and in middle-income countries (OR=1.24, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.47). In addition, people with comorbid diabetes and edentulism had worse health status in the domains of cognition, sleep/energy, and perceived stress, compared with those with diabetes only.
Diabetes was positively associated with edentulism in this sample of more than 175 000 individuals living in LMICs. Providing oral care to individuals with diabetes may potentially lead to a reduction in their risk of edentulism.",0
"The impact of glycemic fluctuation under diabetic condition on peri-implantitis in diabetic patients remains unclear. We hypothesized that glycemic fluctuation has greater adverse effect on experimental peri-implantitis, compared with sustained high blood glucose in diabetes.
Maxillary left first and second molars of diabetic db/db mice were extracted and were replaced with one dental implant in the healed edentulous space. Glycemic control or fluctuation were managed by constant or interrupted oral administration of rosiglitazone to these mice. Meanwhile, experimental peri-implantitis was induced by ligation around implants. After 14 weeks, inflammatory responses, and peri-implant bone loss, together with oral microbiota profile were analyzed. Diabetic mice with glycemic fluctuation showed greater peri-implant bone loss, inflammatory cell infiltration, and osteoclastogenesis, compared with mice with sustained hyperglycemia. Compared to sustained hyperglycemia, glycemic fluctuation led to further increase in IL-1β, TNFα, RANKL, TLR2/4, IRAK1, and TRAF6 mRNA expression in peri-implant gingival tissues. Both rosiglitazone-induced glycemic control and glycemic fluctuation caused microbiota profile change in diabetic mice compared to that in uncontrolled hyperglycemic mice.
This study suggests that glycemic fluctuation may aggravate peri-implantitis inflammation and bone loss, which may be associated with a shift in peri-implant microbial profile towards dysbiotic changes and the activation of TLR2/4-IRAK1-TRAF6 signaling.",0
"To critically assess the unmet oral health needs and oral health-related quality of life among old age home inhabitants in Karnataka, India.
A total of 96 older adults (males=32, 33.33%, females=64, 66.67%) aged 60 years and above, residing in old age homes were included in this cross-sectional study. The mean age of the participants included in the study was 69.25±7.99 years. Oral health status and dental needs were assessed using the Oral Hygiene Index Simplified (OHIS) and the WHO Oral Health Assessment forms. Oral health-related quality of life was evaluated by administrating the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) questionnaire through an interview format.
The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17 was used. Descriptive statistics was tabulated for oral health status and GOHAI scores. Student's 
The mean age of the participants included in the study was 69.25±7.99 years. Twenty-six (27.1%) participants reported diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Most of the participants 89 (91.7%) visited the dentist when they had dental complaints. Among the dentulous study population, the majority of the participants had untreated dental caries indicated for dental extraction and needed periodontal therapy. Amongst the participants, 68 (70.82%) required prosthetic rehabilitation. More than 10 years of residence in old aged homes, over 80 years of age, being female, and completely edentulous groups showed lower total GOHAI scores compared to their counterparts.
The majority of the participants showed unmet oral health needs and lower GOHAI scores indicating poor oral health-related quality of life.",0
"Data on the association between multimorbidity and subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) are lacking from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
To assess the association between multimorbidity and SCC among adults from 48 LMICs.
Cross-sectional, community-based data were analyzed from the World Health Survey 2002-2004. Ten chronic conditions (angina, arthritis, asthma, chronic back pain, depression, diabetes, edentulism, hearing problems, tuberculosis, visual impairment) were assessed. Two questions on subjective memory and learning complaints in the past 30 days were used to create a SCC scale ranging from 0 (No SCC) to 100 (worse SCC). Multivariable linear regression and mediation analyses were conducted to explore the associations.
A total of 224,842 individuals aged≥18 years [mean (SD) age 38.3 (16.0) years; 49.3% males] constituted the final sample. Compared to no chronic conditions, the mean SCC score was higher by 7.13 (95% CI = 6.57-7.69), 14.84 (95% CI = 13.91-15.77), 21.10 (95% CI = 19.49-22.70), 27.48 (95% CI = 25.20-29.76), and 33.99 (95% CI = 31.45-36.53) points for 1, 2, 3, 4, and≥5 chronic conditions. Estimates by sex and age groups (18-44, 45-64,≥65 years) were similar. Nearly 30% of the association between multimorbidity (i.e.,≥2 chronic conditions) and SCC was explained by psychological factors (i.e., perceived stress, sleep problems, anxiety symptoms).
Multimorbidity is associated with SCC among adults in LMICs. Future studies should investigate whether addressing psychological factors in people with multimorbidity can improve cognitive function, and whether screening for SCC in individuals with multimorbidity can be a useful tool to identify individuals at particularly high risk for future cognitive decline.",0
"Diabetic patients are advised to have at least one dental examination per year. It is unclear to what extent different subgroups of US diabetic adults closely follow this recommendation. Thus, we assessed dental care utilization and related factors in a representative sample of US diabetic adults from rural and urban counties.
Cross-sectional data were from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Survey logistic regression was used to account for the complex sampling design.
Among 40,585 eligible participants, 24,887 (60% of the population) had at least one dental visit for any reason within the past year. The lowest compliance was observed among edentulous participants (27%, adjusted OR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.22-0.31 vs. fully dentate). Dental compliance was also negatively associated with having a lower income or education, ever being a smoker, or having barriers to access to care. Rural residents had lower dental compliance compared to urban residents, particularly those without healthcare coverage.
Dental compliance among US adult diabetic individuals was low, particularly among rural residents, and as compared to other recommended diabetic care practices. Future public health interventions may target rural individuals without healthcare coverage, smokers and edentulous individuals. There is a need to integrate dental and medical care to facilitate cross-talks among different health professionals, so that educational preventive messages are reinforced at every healthcare visit.",0
"To determine the association of edentulism with different chronic diseases and mental disorders in Mexicans aged 60 years and over.
A cross-sectional study was carried out using data from the World Health Survey for Mexico, in a probabilistic, multi-stage cluster sampling framework. Data for self-report of chronic diseases (diabetes, arthritis, angina pectoris and asthma), mental disorders (depression and schizophrenia) and edentulism were analyzed. Edentulism data were available for 20 of the 32 States of Mexico. Statistical analysis was performed in Stata 14.0 using the svy module for complex sampling (Complex nature under which individuals are sampled).
In total 4213 subjects were included, representing a population of 7,576,057 individuals. Mean age was 70.13 ± 7.82 years (range 60 to 98); 56.2% were women. Chronic diseases' prevalence and mental disorders prevalence were as follows: diabetes 15.0% (N = 1,132,693); arthritis 13.2% (N = 1,001,667); depression 5.5% (N = 414,912); angina pectoris 4.5% (344,315); asthma 3.6% (N = 269,287); and schizophrenia 2.2% (N = 16,988). The prevalence of edentulism was 26.3%, which pertained to 1,993,463 people aged 60 years and over. Angina in women aged 60 to 69 years (
There was generally sparse association between edentulism on chronic diseases and mental disorders included in the study, except for women aged 60 to 69 years for angina, and in men aged 70 and over, for depression. Although our findings are misaligned with previous reports, longitudinal studies are required to test causal and temporal relationships between edentulism with chronic diseases and mental disorders.",0
"The objective of this study was to report implant survival rates, marginal bone loss, and the impact of prosthesis type among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DMT2), with high hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) values.
This retrospective study utilized patient medical records from an oral surgeon's office. Patients who had moderately or poorly controlled DMT2 with HbA1c values up to 10% were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were partially or fully edentulous patients diagnosed with DMT2 who were subsequently treated with implant-supported prosthetic restorations. Patients were at least 18 years of age. Exclusion criteria were patients who did not present for annual follow-up visits, patient records with incomplete surgical or restorative data, or nondiagnostic radiographs. All the fixed restorations were cement-retained, and the removable restorations were supported by two to six implants. Marginal bone loss and the consequences of prosthetic type were assessed from the last available radiograph compared with the one taken after the surgical procedure.
Data of 357 implants were extracted from the records of 38 patients with HbA1c values (6.9% to 10.0%). The mean follow-up was 7.3 years, with a minimum of 5 years. Six implants failed, yielding a 98.4% overall implant survival rate. The patients were divided into two groups according to the HbA1c values before implant placement. The moderately controlled group included 25 patients with DMT2, with HbA1c values of 6.9% to 8.0%, and the poorly controlled group included 13 patients, with HbA1c values of 8.1% to 10.0%. The overall mean bone loss was 2.02 ± 2.43 mm. In both groups, the maxilla demonstrated more bone loss than the mandible (P < .05). Marginal bone loss in moderately controlled and poorly controlled groups was 1.86 (± 2.21) mm and 2.33 (± 2.85) mm, respectively (P < .05). Removable prostheses also revealed greater bone loss rates compared with fixed prostheses in both groups (P < .05).
Patients with high HbA1c values (8.1% to 10.0%) had more marginal bone loss than those with lower HbA1c values. Removable dentures should be reconsidered as a standard treatment option in these patients.",0
"Few studies have considered more than one behavior, despite the tendency towards multiple behaviors, and there are none that have focused on a Latino population. We determined the concurrence of four unhealthy behaviors related to glycemic control and identified common cognitive factors at advanced stages of readiness for change in patients with type 2 diabetes treated in primary care. A cross-sectional study was carried out during August-December 2018 in northeastern Mexico. We consecutively included patients between 20 and 70 years who were without medical contraindication, physical impediment against exercise, pregnancy and edentulism, among other selection criteria (",0
"Edentulism, extreme consequence of severe periodontitis, carries a high cardiovascular and all-cause death risk. The prevailing phenotype of edentulous patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) has never been defined, neither it is known whether an epigenetic signature of such condition exists.
We collected clinical and biochemical data and administered a questionnaire on oral health in 248 consecutive T2D individuals. Vital status was checked after 17 ± 7 months. miRNAs involved in periodontal inflammation were measured.
Forty-seven patients (19%) were edentulous (ED), a higher prevalence than in the Italian general population (10.9% from ISTAT data). ED were older, with low level of instruction and higher fasting glucose vs not edentulous (noED). Participants displayed a scarce awareness of the association periodontitis-T2D. ED showed a specific epigenetic signature (lower miR214-5p and higher miR126-5p urinary levels). At the follow-up, metabolic profile similarly improved in ED and noED; death occurrence was similar.
In this cohort of T2D, age is the only variable associated with edentulism; such condition displays an epigenetic signature, independent of the clinical phenotype; awareness of the clinical relevance and implications of periodontitis and edentulism are scarce. However, edentulism does not mark an increased rate of micro-macrovascular complications or mortality.",0
"This randomized controlled trial assessed the impact of crestal level position of implants installed in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients rehabilitated with overdentures. Twenty-two mandibular edentulous T2DM patients were submitted to implant placement for retention of an overdenture. By means of a split-mouth design, two implants were installed: one at supracrestal level (SL) and one at crestal level (CL). Clinical, immunoenzymatic and tomographic analyses were performed at prosthesis placement (baseline) and after 6, 12 and 24 months following implant loading. Increased peri-implant probing depths were detected in CL implants when compared with SL implants at all time-points (baseline P=0.047; 6 months P=0.014; 12 months P=0.027; 24 months P=0.036). Indeed, augmented clinical attachment levels were also detected in CL implants when compared with SL implants at all time-points (baseline P=003; 6 months P=0.045; 12 months P=0.029; 24 months P=0.026). CL implants demonstrated increased amounts of interleukin-6 (IL-6) at 6 months (P=0.043) and higher IL-17 (P=0.021), IL-21 (P=0.034) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) concentrations (P=0.030) at 24 months in comparison with SL implants. CL group revealed enhanced bone loss from baseline to 6 (P=0.032), 12 (P=0.043) and 24 months (P=0.028) when compared with SL. In conclusion, this study showed that implants placed supracrestally in T2DM patients rehabilitated with overdentures demonstrated lower bone loss and better clinical parameters with beneficial modulation of peri-implant immunoinflammatory biomarkers when compared with implants positioned at crestal level.",0
"With the higher risk of dental implant failure with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), there is a need to characterize the jaw bones in those individuals. The aim of this post mortem study was to compare jaw bone quality of individuals with T2DM to healthy controls.
Bone cores from the edentulous lower first molar region and the region of mandibular angle were collected from male individuals with T2DM (n = 10, 70.6 ± 4.5 years) and healthy controls (n = 11, 71.5 ± 3.8 years) during autopsy. Within the T2DM, a subgroup treated with oral antidiabetics (OAD) and one on insulin were identified. Bone quality assessment encompassed evaluation of bone microstructure, matrix composition, and cellular activity, using microcomputed tomography (micro-CT), quantitative backscattered electron imaging (qBEI), Raman spectroscopy, and bone histomorphometry.
In the mandibular angle, T2DM showed 51% lower porosity of the lingual cortex (p = 0.004) and 21% higher trabecular thickness (p = 0.008) compared to control. More highly mineralized bone packets were found in the buccal cortex of the mandibular angle in insulin-treated compared to OAD-treated T2DM group (p = 0.034). In the molar region, we found higher heterogeneity of trabecular calcium content in T2DM insulin compared to controls (p = 0.015) and T2DM OAD (p = 0.019). T2DM was associated with lower osteocyte lacunar size in the trabecular bone of the molar region (vs. control p = 0.03).
Alterations in microstructure, mineralization, and osteocyte morphology were determined in jaw bone of individuals with T2DM compared to controls.
Future studies will have to verify if the mild changes determined in this study will translate to potential contraindications for dental implant placements.",0
"The aim of the study was to evaluate implant treatment for partial edentulism in a population of controlled type I diabetic patients. The research hypothesis was that implant survival rate, prevalence of peri-implant tissue infection and marginal bone loss at 2 years follow-up would not differ from a non diabetic population. A total of 106 patients (47=women, 59=men, mean age 38.36 years) presented with partially edentulous jaws. All patients underwent a two stage implant surgery (105 maxillary, 100 mandibular). Diabetic type I patients (53) were scheduled in Group A, while 53 healthy patients formed the Control Group. Clinical and radiological controls were performed from baseline up to 24 months and implants survival rate, presence of peri-implant tissue infections and marginal bone loss were assessed in all ptients. Group A and Control Group were compared by analyzing data at implant level, through either an independent sample t-test, with respect to bone loss, or Fisher Exact tests, with respect to (a) peri-implant mucositis, (b) peri-implantitis, and (c) post-operative wound infection. At the 24-month follow-up, 5 and 3 implants failed in diabetic and non-diabetic patients, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found in implant survival rate between the two groups (Group A: 95.19%; Control Group: 97.03%). Moreover, no statistical significant differences were found in infections occurrence, nor in marginal bone loss. The preliminary results of this prospective study showed how implant treatment for partial edentulism may a be safe and predictable procedure for diabetic type I patients, provided controlled glycemic levels and regular professional oral hygiene sessions.",0
"Depression and tooth loss are significant health problems that affect individuals' functionality and quality of life. Comorbidity between depression and oral diseases has been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between depression and tooth loss in a US representative adult sample.
This study included data from 22,532 adults ≥18 years by combining six 2-year cross-sectional cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) administered between 2005 and 2016. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression adjusted for gender, age, race/ethnicity, smoking, education, socioeconomic status, body mass index, diabetes, and alcohol intake.
Of the total sample, 4.5 percent were edentulous, 10.3 percent were lacking functional dentition (1-19 remaining teeth) and 85.2 percent had functional dentition (≥20 remaining teeth); among whom, the prevalence of depression was 12.4, 11.7, and 5.9 percent, respectively. Compared to individuals without depression, those with depression were more likely to be edentulous or lacking functional dentition versus having functional dentition (adjusted odds ratios (95% CI): 1.48 (1.16-1.89) and 1.43 (1.18-1.75), respectively).
Depression was associated with edentulism and a lack of functional dentition. Further longitudinal and interventional studies are needed to elucidate the nature and direction of the relationship between depression and tooth loss.",0
"This study explores the association between Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) scores and dental pathology such as missing teeth, the (peri-apical) health status and restoration grade of the teeth, and the grade of alveolar bone loss seen on a dental panoramic radiograph (Orthopantomograph-OPG).
In this retrospective cross-sectional study, data was collected from three hospitals spread in the Netherlands. Patients were included when a CAC score and an OPG were available, both recorded within a maximum period of 365 days from 2009-2017. The CAC score was measured on a CT scan, using the Agatston method. To assess dental pathology, the number of missing teeth, the number of dental implants, alveolar bone loss, caries, endodontic treatments, peri-apical radiolucencies, bone loss at implants, impacted teeth and dental cysts, were determined on the OPG. All observers were calibrated. The electronic health records provided information about: gender, age, smoking, Diabetes Mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and Body Mass Index (BMI).
212 patients were included. We found a statistically significant association between the number of missing teeth and the CAC score. When modeling age, sex, and other well-known risk factors for cardiovascular disease, the significant correlation was no longer present after multivariate correction. Furthermore, the results showed a trend for more teeth with peri-apical lesions and a higher percentage of mean alveolar bone loss in the group with the highest CAC scores.
This study showed that being edentulous or missing teeth is correlated to higher CAC scores however failed to be an independent predictor of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. The number of (missing) teeth is an easily accessible marker and could be used as a marker for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) risk by almost any healthcare worker. The current study needs to be considered as an explorative pilot study and could contribute to the design of further (prospective) studies on the relationship between dental pathology and coronary artery calcification by adding clinical information and extra cardiovascular biomarkers.",0
"It is hypothesized that under optimal glycemic control (GC), there is no difference in the survival of implants placed in the zygomatic bone of edentulous patient with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim was to assess the influence of GC on survival of implants placed in the zygomatic bone of an edentulous patient with and without T2DM at the 10-year follow-up. Twenty patients with T2DM (10 with poorly controlled T2DM and 10 with well-controlled T2DM) and 12 patients without T2DM were included. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were recorded, and demographic data were collected from all participants. Peri-implant inflammatory parameters (plaque index [PI], probing depth [PD], crestal bone loss [BL], and gingival index [GI]) were measured in all patients. Group comparisons were done, and P values, which were less than .01, were indicative of statistical significance. Twenty and 12 male patients with and without T2DM, respectively, were included. Among patients with T2DM, 10 and 10 individuals had poorly and well-controlled T2DM, respectively. The mean HbA1c levels were significantly higher in patients with poorly controlled T2DM (9.2 ± 0.7%) compared with well-controlled T2DM (4.8 ± 0.3%; P < .01) and nondiabetic individuals (4.6 ± 0.3%; P < .01). The crestal BL on the mesial (P < .01) and distal (P < .01) surfaces, PD (P < .01), PI (P < .01), and GI (P < .01) were significantly higher around all zygoma implants placed in patients with poorly controlled T2DM compared with patients with well-controlled T2DM and patients without T2DM. These clinicoradiographic parameters were comparable around zygoma implants placed in patient with well-controlled T2DM and in subjects without T2DM. Optimal GC is essential for the long-term stability of zygomatic plants in patients with T2DM.",0
"Periodontal disease and diabetes are widespread comorbid conditions that are detrimental to oral and overall health. Dentists' performing chairside screenings for undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (UDM) can be beneficial to both patients and providers. The authors determined UDM rates in a population-based study and whether UDM and periodontal disease were independently associated.
Data from 7,343 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study visit 4 were used to determine rates of UDM by periodontal status, edentulism, and body mass index. The authors used a χ
UDM rates overall were 5.6%. The highest rates occurred in patients who were obese and edentulous (12.6%) and obese and had severe periodontal disease (12.2%). Significant associations were found for UDM and severe periodontal disease (Periodontal Profile Classes system stage IV) (odds ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 2.88). Edentulism was significantly associated with UDM in the Periodontal Profile Classes system model (odds ratio, 1.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.27 to 2.75) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American Academy of Periodontology index (odds ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 2.67). Hyperglycemia was found in participants of all body mass index categories.
UDM is significantly associated with obesity, edentulism, and periodontitis. These characteristics could help dentists identify patients at higher risk of developing DM. Patients without these characteristics still have UDM, so dentists performing chairside diabetes screening for all patients would yield additional benefit.
Dental offices are a major point of contact within the US health care system. Diabetes screening in this setting can provide important health information with direct relevance to patient care.",0
"The prospective case-control study aimed at comparing bone resorption at prospective implant sites in anterior mandible between diabetic and nondiabetic patients using digital volumetric tomography (DVT) and establishes a correlation between glycemic control and residual ridge resorption.
Twenty apparently healthy and 20 type 2 diabetic edentulous male patients between the age group of 55-65 years providing with written consent were recruited in the present study. First-time denture wearers were considered who were edentulous for at least 1 year. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) analysis of all individuals were done to affirm the diagnosis and quantify glycemic control. DVT of all the individuals were performed and bone height was determined at 5 prospective implant sites were determined, on the same scans Wical and Swoope method was used to determine the residual ridge resorption on the right and left side of mandible for all the individuals. The data wer tabulated and descriptive and analytical statistics were performed to compare bone resorption between diabetic and nondiabetic groups. Pearson's correlation was carried out to establish correlation between glycemic control and residual ridge resorption.
There was no statistical difference between the bone height measurements at prospective implant sites between diabetic and nondiabetic groups. The residual ridge resorption was more in diabetics when compared to nondiabetics, and a significant moderate negative correlation existed between the glycemic control and residual ridge resorption on left (r = -0.541; 
It can be concluded from the present study that bone resorption at prospective implant sites is statistically similar in diabetics when compared to nondiabetics. Patients with poor glycemic control show increased residual ridge resorption.",0
"It is believed that oral infections can increase the risk of systematic diseases, such as atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. It seems that oral invasive pathogens induce a systemic inflammatory response via mediators released by the cardiovascular system and liver, which increases the risk to the patient of these systematic infections, such as hypertension. On the basis of previous studies of the stomatognathic system, investigating the coexistence of systemic diseases and inflammation in the oral cavity, it can be expected that there is a connection between inflammation of the denture-bearing area in patients using acrylic removable dentures and the presence of systemic diseases, and that patients with inflammation in oral mucosa are more likely to have systemic diseases.
A retrospective study was carried out on a group of patients seeking prosthetic treatment at the Prosthetic Department of the University Dental Clinic (UKS) from March 2012 to February 2013. All data were collected using a UKS electronic database with KS-SOMED. The minimum period of use for removable prostheses was five years.
According to anamnesis, the most common systemic diseases in our study group were hypertension disease. In total, 58% of patients with hypertension disease had no inflammation in the oral cavity.
The occurrence of systemic diseases in edentulous people using removable prosthetic restorations, and the subsequent use of medications for these diseases, may result in a lack of clinical symptoms of concomitant fungal infection of the oral mucosa.",0
"This study aims to show the long-time stability of straight and tilted implants loaded immediately with a provisional resin bridge followed by a definitive prosthodontic rehabilitation in edentulous jaws despite difficult hygiene conditions postoperatively.
This study included the participation of 23 patients and the restoration of 170 dental implants in 32 edentulous jaws. Patient data was analyzed from the start of treatment with a minimum follow-up period of 6 years in order to determine long-term implant success rates. However, the age of patients at time of surgery significantly affected the BOP to the detriment of younger patients (median 62 years old).
Although there was a higher risk of implant failure due to general disease, all the implants in this study survived successfully. As a replacement for a complete dental arch, the reduced number of implants in combination with the avoidance of augmentations reduces treatment costs. The immediate fixed prosthetic restoration of edentulous jaws thus represents a reliable therapeutic alternative to a two- to three-stage procedure. Optimized aftercare including professional teeth cleaning (PTC) (at least twice a year) can minimize the anamnestic effect of smoking, diabetes mellitus, and osteoporosis on BOP and possible bone loss.",0
"Risk prediction in implant dentistry presents specific challenges including the dependence of observations from patients with multiple implants and rare outcome events. The aim of this study was to use advanced statistical methods based on penalized regression to assess risk factors in implant dentistry.
We conducted a retrospective study from January 2016 to November 2018 recording postoperative complications including bleeding, hematoma, local infection, and nerve damage, as well as early implant failure. We further assessed patient- and implant-related risk factors including smoking and diabetes, as well as treatment parameters including types of gaps and surgical procedures. Univariable and multivariable generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were estimated to assess predictor effects, and a prediction model was fitted using L1 penalized estimation (lasso).
In a total of 1,132 patients (mean age: 50.6 ± 16.5 years, 55.4% female) and 2,413 implants, postoperative complications occurred in 71 patients. Sixteen implants were lost prior to loading. Multivariable GEE models showed a higher risk of any complication for diabetes mellitus (p = .006) and bone augmentation (p = .039). The models further revealed a higher risk of local infection for bone augmentation (p = .003), and a higher risk of hematoma formation for diabetes mellitus (p = .007) and edentulous jaws (p = .024). The lasso model did not select any risk factors into the prediction model.
Using novel methodology well-suited to tackle the specific challenges of risk prediction in implant dentistry, we were able to reliably estimate associations of risk factors with outcomes.",0
"Sleep deficiency is implicated as a risk factor for several systemic conditions. Loss of teeth has a profound effect on the individual's physiologic and psychologic health and quality of life. This study aimed to assess the association between tooth loss and sleep duration and determine if anterior and/or posterior tooth loss is a significant predictor.
A total of 22,483 individuals ≥ 18 years who participated in the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2016 cycles were included. Multinomial logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, smoking, diabetes, body mass index, socioeconomic level, education, alcohol, and depression was performed to examine the association between sleep duration and tooth loss.
Compared to individuals with > 20 remaining teeth, those who were completely edentulous, had 1-10 or 11-20 teeth remaining were more likely to be in the deficient sleep category (OR [95% CI] = 1.59 [1.35-1.87], 1.29 [1.07-1.54], and 1.26 [1.11-1.43], respectively). When the numbers of both missing anterior and posterior teeth were entered in the model, only posterior teeth were significant. There was a 4% increase in the odds of being in the deficient sleep category for each missing posterior tooth (OR [95% CI] = 1.04 [1.02-1.05]).
Tooth loss was significantly associated with deficient sleep and posterior tooth loss appeared to be the main contributor. Although further research is needed to clarify the nature of this association, our results suggest that improving oral health might have an impact on overall health and quality of life.",0
"Extensive tooth loss can lead to poor diet resulting in weight loss or obesity (1). It can also detract from physical appearance and impede speech, factors that can restrict social contact, inhibit intimacy, and lower self-esteem (1). Chronic medical conditions and oral conditions share common risk factors (2). Persons with chronic conditions are more likely to have untreated dental disease, which can result in tooth loss. Three measures of tooth loss during 1999-2004 and 2011-2016 were estimated by comparing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for each period among adults aged ≥50 years with selected chronic conditions.* The three measures were 1) edentulism (having no teeth); 2) severe tooth loss (having eight or fewer teeth) (3); and 3) lacking functional dentition (having <20 teeth out of 28, which is considered a full set for the purpose of NHANES assessments) (4). During 2011-2016, prevalences of edentulism and severe tooth loss were ≥50% higher among adults with fair or poor general health, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, diabetes, emphysema, heart disease, liver condition, or stroke than among those with those adults without the chronic condition. Lack of functional dentition was also more prevalent among adults with chronic conditions than among persons without these conditions. Tooth loss is preventable with self-care and routine dental visits (1). To encourage these behaviors, public health professionals can educate the public about the association between having a chronic condition and tooth loss, and primary care providers can educate their patients about the importance of healthy behaviors and screen and refer them for needed dental care.",0
"To investigate the effect of complete denture wearing on residual ridge resorption in edentulous patient compared with edentulous patient who never wore dentures.
Patients who had been edentulous for at least five year who had never worn dentures successfully were matched to edentulous denture wearing control patients. To control for factors possibly associated with alveolar ridge resorption patients who had been rendered edentulous in one arch before the other, smokers, those taking steroids, bisphosphonates, with histories of autoimmune diseases, diabetes mellitus or osteoporosis at any time during their period of edentulousness were excluded. Case and control groups were matched for age, sex and time since being rendered edentulous. Statistical analyses were undertaken using Person's Chi squared (X
30 edentulous patients who had not worn dentures for at least five years were identified and matched with 30 controls. All control patients were the same age ± 2 years and had been edentulous for the same number of years ± 2 years of their respective controls. There was no significant difference between age and time since being rendered edentulous between case and control. Denture wearers had significantly more maxillary and mandibular residual alveolar ridge resorption than did non denture wearers. Severe ridge resorption was mostly confined to the denture wearing group.
Patients wearing complete dentures for more than 5 years had significantly more residual alveolar ridge resorption than was found in non-denture wearing edentulous patients.",0
"Diabetes affects one in 10 adults and periodontal disease affects four in 10 adults in the USA, and they are linked. Individuals with diabetes are more likely to suffer from periodontal disease and periodontal disease affects glycemic control and complications of diabetes. The role of diabetes as a risk factor for periodontal disease and other oral conditions will be discussed in this review. The fact that type 2 diabetes, especially uncontrolled, is a risk factor for periodontal disease has long been recognized. However, the role of type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes in periodontal risk has recently been described. Also, diabetes as a risk factor for tooth loss has more recently been described and the deleterious effects of tooth loss, especially edentulism, in comparing the diets of patients with diabetes is now fully appreciated. From longitudinal studies it is clear that diabetes often precedes periodontitis and, hence, may contribute to the causal pathway of periodontitis. Other oral manifestations of diabetes include increased risk of oral and nonoral (vaginal) fungal infections. In patients with diabetes there is often reduced salivary flow associated with diabetes medications and neuropathy affecting the salivary glands. This may lead to increased caries. Burning mouth, resulting from diabetes neuropathy, and taste impairment may also be seen. It has long been known that there is delayed wound healing in patients with diabetes, especially if uncontrolled. Hence, it is critical to achieve good glycemic control before carrying out surgical procedures or dental implant placement in patients with diabetes.",0
"Periodontal Disease (PD) is associated with complications of diabetes. Control of the PD reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship of PD with duration, severity of diabetes and eGFR.
A Prospective observational study conducted at Sidhi Vinayaka Hospitals (SVH) Sangareddy during the period of January 2014 to December 2019. Total 1436 patients with a definite diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), between the ages of 45-60 years were included. They were classified according to CPITN score for PD and compared against the variables.
A total of 1436 consecutive outpatients attending to SVH were included. Among them 662 (46.1%) were males and 774(53.9%) were females. The mean age of the patients was 48.3(SD ± 10.62) and mean duration of diabetes was 2.9(SD ± 4.18). The mean fasting blood glucose was 198.5(SD ± 85), mean post prandial blood glucose was 277.2 (SD ± 107.7) and mean HBA1c was 9.98% (SD ± 2.6). Among the study group 1198 (83.4%) had none/mild (Grade I) PD, 192(13.4%) had moderate/severe (Grade II) PD and 46(3.2%) were completely edentulous (Grade III).
There is a linear correlation between PD and age of patient, duration of diabetes, eGFR and level of glycemic status among rural population with T2DM.",0
"Increasing evidence supports a positive association between periodontal disease and total cancer risk. We evaluated the association of clinically assessed periodontal disease and a consequence, edentulism with total cancer mortality in participants without a prior cancer diagnosis in a U.S. nationally representative population. Included were 6,034 participants aged ≥40 years without a prior cancer diagnosis who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III. Periodontal health was measured by trained dentists. Cancer deaths (n = 702) were ascertained during a median of 21.3 years of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the association of periodontal disease and edentulism with total cancer mortality using no periodontal disease/dentate as the reference and adjusting for potential demographic, lifestyle including smoking and social factor confounders. Fifteen percent had periodontitis and 17% were edentulous. Periodontitis was not statistically significantly associated with risk of total cancer death after multivariable adjustment. Edentulism was associated with an increased risk of cancer mortality (hazard ratio = 1.50, 95% confidence interval = 1.12-2.00) after multivariable adjustment, including in men and women and in each racial/ethnic group studied. The positive association was observed in overweight/obese participants but not participants with normal body mass index, more strongly in prediabetic/diabetic participants than in participants without diabetes and in ever cigarette smokers but not in never cigarette smokers. In this U.S. nationally representative population, those with edentulism, but not periodontal disease, had a higher risk of total cancer death, especially in those with shared risk factors for periodontal disease and cancer.",0
"The purpose of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate clinical results of the passive fit of the substructure in the Toronto bridge and the chipping or delamination of the ceramic veneering on the zirconia-support, after 5 years, in nine patients rehabilitated with zirconia crowns cemented on titanium bars using CAD/CAM technology.
A total of nine healthy patient fully edentulous in the upper and lower jaws with non-contributory past medical anamnesis needing full fixed total prosthesis maxilla and mandible were included in this clinical study, where a total 9 mandibles and 9 jaws were treated. The inclusion criteria in order for a patient to participate in the study were: a signed consent form, fully edentulous in the upper and lower jaws, required a full fixed total prosthesis restoration. The exclusion criteria were age limitation of less than 18 years old, chemotherapy, head and neck radiation therapy, diabetes or periodontal disease, smoking and severe illness. All patients received zirconia crowns cemented on titanium bars using CAD/CAM technology. The primary outcome of this study was to examine the survival rate of the zirconia crowns cemented on titanium bars using CAD/CAM technology during the observation period. Any chipping or delamination of the zirconia crowns of the restorations was considered as failure. The secondary outcome was to evaluate the passive fit of the substructure on the implants, loose of occlusal screws, implant survival and satisfactory occlusion.
In 5 years of follow-up no evidence of chipping or delamination of the ceramic veneering on the zirconia crown supported were observed. Fifteen finished protesis (93.75%) showed satisfactory occlusion and only one case (6.25%) required significant occlusal adjustment. During the first year recall all bars were stable (100%) no mobility of protheses was recorded. After 5 years all bars were stable (100%) and no mobility of protheses was recorded.
The computerized workflow for the process of building bar and prosthesis ensures reproducible results and excellent adaptation and passive insertion of them, as well as conditions for avoiding mechanical complications and guarantees stability of screw-implant abutments.",0
"To assess the pattern of bone loss in peri-implantitis in partially edentulous patients and relate patient and implant/site characteristics that may influence such patterns.
In this retrospective study, the records of partially edentulous patients with dental implants were stratified according to sex, age, smoking, and diabetes. Implants were stratified according to site, number of years in function, presence of adjacent implants, diameter, bone-grafted site, and implant platform. All these variables were obtained from previous periodontal charts and radiographs. The implants were then classified into two main groups: (1) bone loss as defined by the presence of progressive marginal bone change found on radiographs at least 12 months following prosthesis placement compared to a baseline with a threshold ≥ 2 threads of bone loss; and (2) no bone loss as defined by no detected bone change or bone level change with a threshold < 2 threads. The bone loss group was further divided into three subgroups according to pattern: vertical, horizontal, and combined. Descriptive analyses were applied to assess the frequency of the pattern of bone loss (horizontal, vertical, and combined). A statistical regression model was used to find if there was a significant correlation between patient/implant characteristics and the pattern of bone loss.
A total of 304 charts with 540 implants met the inclusion criteria. One randomly selected implant per patient through Microsoft Excel software was included in this study. Of these, 157 (51.6%) of examined charts were men and 147 (48.4%) were women. The patients' mean age was 63.9 ± 11.4 years (range: 27 to 85 years) at implant placement, and implants had been in function for 12 to 120 months (median: 37 months). The percentage of implants that had bone loss was 24.7% (75 out of 304). The pattern of bone loss was 65%, 22%, and 13% for vertical, horizontal, and combined, respectively. Implants that had been placed in surgically bone-grafted sites had increased odds of vertical bone loss with either narrow or wide implants (OR = 2.5 [P = .04] and 3.1 [P = .01], respectively). The presence of adjacent implants had significantly (P = .003) increased odds of horizontal bone loss (OR = 5.1).
Approximately one-quarter of dental implants (24.7%) developed bone loss beyond normal physiologic remodeling. Vertical bone loss around single implants was the most common pattern (65%), particularly around implants placed in bone-grafted sites with odds ratio of 2.5 for narrow implants vs 3.1 for wide implants. In the presence of adjacent implants, the odds of horizontal bone loss was 5.1 (P = .003).",0
"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and periodontal disease are two highly prevalent, directly and independently associated long-term conditions that disproportionately impact Indigenous Māori in New Zealand (NZ). Although poorly understood, a number of social and biological mechanisms connect these conditions. This qualitative study explored experiences of T2DM and oral and dental (hereafter oral/dental) health; access to oral/dental health care; whether participants' experiences supported or challenged existing evidence; and sought suggestions for improving oral/dental health in a high-deprivation rural area of Northland, NZ.
Participants (n = 33) meeting the study criteria: self-identified Māori ethnicity, aged ≥ 18-years with glycated haemoglobin (HBA1c) >65 mmol/L were recruited via the local primary care clinic in September-December 2015; two left the study prior to data collection. During face-to-face semi-structured interviews, participants (n = 31) were asked How does diabetes affect your teeth? and When did you last access dental care? Kaupapa Māori (KM) theory and methodology provided an important decolonizing lens to critically analyse the fundamental causes of Indigenous health inequities.
Independent analysis of qualitative data by three KM researchers identified four themes: access barriers to quality care; pathways to edentulism; the 'cost' of edentulism; and, unmet need. Results contributed towards informing Mana Tū-an evidence-based KM programme for diabetes in primary care-to be introduced in this and other communities from 2018.
Oral health is integral to diabetes management, and vice versa. Subsidized specialist referrals for oral-dental health care for Māori with T2DM could improve glycaemic control and diabetes outcomes and reduce diabetes-related complications among this population.",0
"A balanced nutrient intake is important for patients with diabetes. Even if individuals have the same number of residual natural teeth, there are large differences in the masticatory performance between edentulous sites restored with a fixed dental prosthesis, including dental implants, and those restored with a removable dental prosthesis. This study assessed whether the prevalence and control of diabetes differed based on the use of removable dental prostheses through an analysis of nationally representative data.
Overall, 8,155 individuals (3,525 men and 4,630 women) aged ≥ 50 years were included in this study and were classified into the following 3 groups: group 1, did not use any removable dental prostheses (NF); group 2, used removable partial dentures (RPD); and group 3, used removable complete dentures on at least 1 jaw (CD). The characterization of diabetic patients and glycemic control were analyzed and compared among groups. To determine the relationship between diabetes and the use of dental prostheses, multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed (
The adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for diabetes in men participants in groups NF, RPD, and CD were 1 (reference), 1.165 (0.878-1.544), and 1.491 (1.034-2.151), respectively, after adjusting for confounding factors. Diabetes and glycemic control were significantly associated with the use of removable dental prostheses among men.
The use of removable dental prostheses is a potential risk indicator for uncontrolled diabetes in Korean men adults, suggesting the need for a comprehensive approach to minimize the complications of diabetes mellitus.",0
"The aim of the study was to assess oral health status and its correlations with the general health in older adults living in residential houses in Georgia. The study was conducted in 2017-2018 years based on WHO recommendations. The study got approval from bioethical council of National Center for Disease Control and Public Health, protocol #2017-039, 28.06.2017y. 300 voluntary residents from various residential houses for older people (aged 65 years and more) were observed in regions of Georgia: ""Basiliada"" (Tbilisi), residential home of municipality of Samtredia, (Imereti), residential home ""Carefree old age"" (Kakheti). Age groups were divided as following: 65-74; 75-84; 85<. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0 was used for statistical analysis. DMFT was assessed to be 28.74. Significantly high prevalence of needs of prosthetic treatment 91.1% (p=0.0005), full edentulism 36.2% (p=0.0049), participants with the extraction of more than 20 teeth 81.3% (p=0.0000) and unsatisfactory oral hygiene 39.3% (p=0.0003) were observed. Prevalence of systemic diseases was assessed as the following: cardiovascular disease - 56%, gastroenterologycal diseases - 6%, diabetes - 2.9%, respiratory disease - 8.4%, oncological disease - 6.7%, dementia - 24.2 %.( p<0.005). Cardiovascular system diseases appeared to be one of the most commonly encountered diseases in dental practice. Based on the study results new program was created ""Improve of oral hygiene of older adults living in residential homes in Georgia"" in order to increase their access to the dental care, including preventive dental care and improve oral health related quality of life.",0
"To assess oral health status of Tunisian diabetic mellitus patients.
We carried a cross-sectional study among 100 uncontrolled diabetic mellitus patients. An oral health survey was developed to collect their socio-demographic characteristics and to assess their oral health behavior. Each patient benefited of an oral examination. Clinical and biological data were collected from medical file of patients.
In terms of number of brushings, 44% of diabetic mellitus patients brushed their teeth at least twice a day, 25% brushed once a day, 10% occasionally and 21% did not used to brush their teeth. The last visit to a dentist dated since less than a year ago for 48% of participants and 8% reported that they hadn't never visit a dentist. Oral hygiene and the rate of dental consultation were correlated with gender but not with glycemic control. Only 17% had complete dentition, 75% were partially dentate and 8% were completely edentulous. More than half of the diabetics had at least 5 missing teeth. About 67% had had experienced tooth decay. The presence of tooth decay was not correlated with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). The examining dentist estimated that nine out of ten patients required dental care.
The oral health status of diabetic mellitus patients in Tunisia was bad. The need for dental care was real and high but often overlooked. The establishment of a national oral health care policy seems to be a national priority today.",0
"To present a digital method that combines intraoral and face scanning for the computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM) fabrication of implant-supported bars for maxillary overdentures.
Over a 2-year period, all patients presenting to a private dental clinic with a removable complete denture in the maxilla, seeking rehabilitation with implants, were considered for inclusion in this study. Inclusion criteria were fully edentulous maxilla, functional problems with the preexisting denture, opposing dentition, and sufficient bone volume to insert four implants. Exclusion criteria were age < 55 years, need for bone augmentation, uncompensated diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised status, radio- and/or chemotherapy, and previous treatment with oral and/or intravenous aminobisphosphonates. All patients were rehabilitated with a maxillary overdenture supported by a CAD/CAM polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) implant-supported bar. The outcomes of the study were the passive fit/adaptation of the bar, the 1-year implant survival, and the success rates of the implant-supported overdentures.
15 patients (6 males, 9 females; mean age 68.8 ± 4.7 years) received 60 implants and were rehabilitated with a maxillary overdenture supported by a PEEK bar, designed and milled from an intraoral digital impression. The intraoral scans were integrated with face scans, in order to design each bar with all available patient data (soft tissues, prosthesis, implants, and face) in the correct spatial position. When testing the 3D-printed resin bar, 12 bars out of 15 (80%) had a perfect passive adaptation and fit; in contrast, 3 out of 15 (20%) did not have a sufficient passive fit or adaptation. No implants were lost, for a 1-year survival of 100% (60/60 surviving implants). However, some complications (two fixtures with peri-implantitis in the same patient and two repaired overdentures in two different patients) occurred. This determined a 1-year success rate of 80% for the implant-supported overdenture.
In this study, the combination of intraoral and face scans allowed to successfully restore fully edentulous patients with maxillary overdentures supported by 4 implants and a CAD/CAM PEEK bar. Further studies are needed to confirm these outcomes.",0
"The use of dental implants is nowadays a well-accepted and highly predictable treatment modality for restoring the dentition and reestablishing the masticatory function of edentulous and partially edentulous patients. Despite the high predictability and excellent long-term survival rates reported for implant therapy, complications may still occur and can jeopardize both short- and long-term success. The present paper provides an overview on the most important aspects related to the etiology, prevention, and management of complications associated with implant therapy. Data from the literature indicate that a number of factors, such as surgical trauma, implant diameter, type of implant-abutment connection, abutment disconnection and reconnection, presence of microgap, and implant malpositioning, can substantially influence the biologic processes of bone remodeling and biofilm formation, thus increasing the rate of short- and long-term hard- and soft-tissue complications. Other factors, such as excess cement at cement-retained prosthetic restorations, abutment mobility, and infections (e.g. peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis) caused by bacterial biofilm, are further causes for complications and failures. More recent evidence also indicates that besides the need for sufficient bone volume surrounding the implant, the presence of an adequate width and thickness of attached mucosa may improve biofilm control and limit crestal bone resorption. Furthermore, emerging evidence points also to the pivotal role of human factors as one of the most important causes of complications in implant dentistry. It can be concluded that clinicians need to consider all biologic and biomechanical factors affecting implant placement and survival, as well as undergo adequate training to improve their surgical skills to control and prevent implant complications. Careful patient selection and control of environmental and systemic factors, such as smoking, diabetes etc., coupled with an accurate surgical and prosthetic planning, enable a better prevention and control of infections.",0
"To analyze the risk factors by logistic regression and perform the analysis of the survival rate of osseointegrated dental implants placed in public and private institutions.
An analytic-multicentric study was carried out, where 1279 dental implants that were placed by specialists from January 2006 to October 2017 in public and private institutions (UPCH-SI, HCFAP, CMNAVAL, UPCH-SM, and UPSJB) were evaluated. The variables sex (X1), location (X2), hypertension (X3), antibiotic prophylaxis (X4), diabetes (X5), osteoporosis (X6), bisphosphonates (X7), history of periodontitis (X8), hypercholesterolemia (X9), bone quality (X10), bone quantity (X11), design (X12), smoker (X13), connection (X14), edentulism type (X15), staging (X16), 3D guided surgery (X17), load (X18), bone graft (X19), peri-implantitis (X20), mucositis (X21), and GBR (X22) were collected and analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The logit analysis was performed among all the variables to choose the best statistical model that explains the true risk factors. The analysis was performed by multivariate logistic regression and the Kaplan-Meier test, at a level of statistical significance of 
It was found that the failure rate of the 1279 implants evaluated was 17.98% corresponding to only 23 implants lost as they have good longevity over time. When establishing the best multivariate logistic regression model, it was found that the variables that remained stable in relation to their statistically significant value and more stable confidence intervals were age, osteoporosis, bisphosphonates, history of periodontitis, bone quality, bone graft, connection, number of implants, GBR (guided bone regeneration), and follow-up.
Dental implants placed by specialists in public and private institutions had a failure rate similar to that in studies previously published in other countries.",0
"To determine factors associated with older adults becoming edentulous (complete tooth loss).
Longitudinal study over a 6-year period.
United States, 2006, 2012.
Nationally representative US sample of adults, aged 50 years and older (n = 9982), participating in the Health and Retirement Study in 2006 and 2012. At the outset, they were dentate and not institutionalized.
None.
Self-report of being dentate or edentulous, demographic variables, dental utilization and other health behaviors, self-rated general health, and incidence between 2006 and 2012 of comorbid medical conditions, functional limitations, and disabilities.
From 2006 to 2012, 563 individuals (5%) became edentulous and 9419 (95%) remained dentate. Adults who became edentulous by 2012 were more likely than those who remained dentate to be black/African American compared to white, to be less educated, were current smokers, had diabetes, and reported poorer self-rated general health, more functional limitations and disabilities, and fewer dental visits (all P < .0001), among other factors. Of those with regular dental visits (at least once every 2 years during the 6-year period), 2.3% became edentulous compared to 9.9% among those without regular dental visits. After adjusting for age and other potential confounders, there was a strong association with poor dental attendance and smoking. Nonregular dental attenders were more likely than regular attenders to become edentulous (odds ratio [OR] = 2.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.12-3.53), and current smokers were more likely than never smokers to become edentulous (OR = 2.46; 95% CI = 1.74-3.46).
Although more contemporaneous data are needed to determine causality, regular dental utilization and smoking are modifiable factors that could prevent edentulism, even when many other comorbid conditions are present. J Am Geriatr Soc, 1-7, 2019. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:2318-2324, 2019.",0
"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor for periodontitis for over 40 years and novel evidence suggests that periodontitis has an impact on glycemic control in patients with diabetes. This study aimed to compare oral health complications in diabetic older patients from Brazil and France.
This cross-sectional study included 120 patients aged 65 and over diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Sixty patients were admitted to a center for diabetes and hypertension care in Brazil and 60 patients were admitted to the Rouen University hospital. Dental conditions were assessed through the decayed, missing and filled teeth index and periodontal condition was assessed using the Community Periodontal Index. The significance threshold was p < 0.05.
Decayed teeth differed statistically between the groups (p = 0.001). The French group presented more tooth mobility, gingival recession and furcation involvement (p < 0.001). Tooth brushing frequency differed significantly between the groups (p < 0.030). The main cause of missing teeth was periodontitis in the French group and caries and periodontitis in the Brazilian group (p < 0.001). Statistical significance was found for use of fixed upper (p = 0.013) and lower (p = 0.013) dentures in the French group. The French group needed upper denture rehabilitation (p = 0.010) while the Brazilian group needed lower denture rehabilitation (p = 0.003).
Edentulism was prevalent in diabetic older people in both countries. However, the French participants presented with better oral health.",0
" There are limited studies assessing rural-urban disparities among older adults in Africa including South Africa.
 This study explores rural-urban health disparities among older adults in a population-based survey in South Africa.
 Data for this study emanated from the 2008 study on 'Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) wave 1' (N = 3280) aged 50 years or older in South Africa.
 Associations between exposure variables and outcome variables (health status variables and chronic conditions) were examined through bivariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression.
 Rural dwellers were more likely to be older, black African and had lower education and wealth than urban dwellers. Rural and urban dwellers reported a similar prevalence of self-rated health status, quality of life, severe functional disability, arthritis, asthma, lung disease, hypertension, obesity, underweight, stroke and/or angina, low vision, depression, anxiety and nocturnal sleep problems. Adjusting for socio-demographic and health risk behaviour variables, urban dwellers had a higher prevalence of diabetes (OR: 2.36, 95% CI: 1.37, 4.04), edentulism (OR: 2.79, 95% CI: 1.27, 6.09) and cognitive functioning (OR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.27, 2.85) than rural dwellers.
 There are some rural-urban health disparities in South Africa, that is, urban dwellers had a higher prevalence of diabetes, edentulism and cognitive functioning than rural ones. Understanding these rural-urban health variations may help in developing better strategies to improve health across geolocality in South Africa.",0
"Immediate functional loading of one-piece dental implants has become an accepted treatment modality for fixed restorations in fully edentulous mandibles and maxillae. Nevertheless, studies regarding immediate loading procedures in extraction sites in both the jaws, as well as in segment reconstructions and single-tooth replacements, are limited.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the presently used protocol for immediate functional loading (within maximum 3 days) of one-piece implants which are placed according to the following methods as published by the IF.
This prospective cohort study included totally 87 consecutively treated patients who receive 1169 immediately loaded one-piece Strategic Implant
Immediate functional loading of using multiple, cortically anchored basal screw implants as a support for fixed full-arch and segment prosthesis in the upper and lower jaw demonstrated a high cumulative implant survival rate after an observation period of up to 57 months. Neither hypertension nor diabetes and neither smoking nor bending of the implant's neck had an influence on the success of the implants observed in this study. Within the limits of this study (5100 Strategic Implants were observed over a period of up to 57 months), ""peri-implantitis"" was not observed at all.
The treatment concept developed for the technology of the Strategic Implant® is safe and effective and it avoids bone augmentations and ""peri-implantitis"".",0
"Periodontitis is the leading cause of severe tooth loss and edentulism in adults worldwide and is closely linked to systemic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Porphyromonas gingivalis is the key pathogen in periodontitis. Herein, we provided the first evidence that bismuth drugs suppress P. gingivalis in its planktonic, biofilm, and intracellular states. In total, 42 bismuth-associated proteins were identified including its major virulent factors (e.g., gingipains, hemagglutinin HagA, and fimbriae). Bismuth perturbed its iron acquisition, disturbed the energy metabolism and virulence, and deactivated multiple key enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase and thioredoxins). Moreover, bismuth inhibited its biofilm formation and disrupted the 3-day matured biofilms. Notably, the internalized P. gingivalis in various human cells (e.g., human gingival epithelium progenitors, HGEPs) was oppressed by bismuth but not the commonly used antibiotic metronidazole. Importantly, bismuth drugs enabled the counteraction of immuno-inflammatory responses in different host cells perturbed by P. gingivalis. The production of IL-6 and IL-8 attenuated by P. gingivalis in both of native and IL-1β-stimulated HGEPs was restored, while the bacterium-enhanced expression of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNFα in THP-1 macrophages was alleviated. This proof-of-concept study brings prospects for the potential reposition of the routinely used anti-Helicobacter pylori bismuth drugs to better manage inflammatory diseases such as periodontitis and P. gingivalis-related complex systemic disorders.",0
"Racial or ethnic health disparities have been evidently apparent during the apartheid era in South Africa. This study aims to assess ethnic health disparities in four elderly population groups.
Data for this study emanated from the 2008 study of ""Global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) wave 1"" (N = 3284) aged 50 years or older in South Africa. Associations between exposure variables and outcome variables (health status variables and chronic conditions) were examined through bivariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression.
Indians or Asians reported the highest prevalence of poor self-rated health (23.7%) and functional disability (11.6% and 29.1%). Coloureds had the lowest grip strength (55.3%) and Whites the highest cognitive functioning (80.1%). Coloureds had the highest prevalence of hypertension (85.0%), stroke and/or angina (15.0%), edentulism (26.8%) and low vision (50.6%); and Indians or Asians had the highest prevalence of arthritis (43.5%) and diabetes (24.4%). In adjusted analysis, Whites (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.24, Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.11, 0.57) and Coloureds (OR: 0.50, CI: 0.29, 0.87) had lower odds of self-reported health status compared to Black Africans. Coloureds (OR: 0.36, CI: 0.22, 0.61) had lower odds of grip strength than Black Africans. Indians or Asians had higher odds of functional disability (OR: 1.87, CI: 1.03, 3.02) and diabetes (OR: 2.65, CI: 1.45, 4.83) than Black Africans. Whites (OR: 3.92, CI: 1.63, 9.41) and Coloureds (OR: 2.14, CI: 1.21, 3.78) had higher odds of cognitive functioning than Black Africans. Whites had lower odds (OR: 0.54, CI: 0.31, 0.93) and Indians or Asians had higher odds (OR: 1.91, CI: 1.91, 1.01, 3.59) of arthritis than Black Africans. Coloureds had a higher prevalence of hypertension (OR: 1.71, CI: 1.14, 2.58), stroke and/or angina (OR: 1.74, CI = 1.36, 2.22), edentulism (OR: 6.51, CI: 4.07, 10.41) and low vision (OR: 1.68, CI: 1.29, 2.19) than Black Africans.
There are still ethnic health disparities in South Africa in the post-apartheid era (i.e., Black Africans [lower cognitive functioning], Whites [poor self-reported health status and edentulism], Coloureds [poor self-reported health status, lower grip strength, arthritis, hypertension, stroke and/or angina, edentulism and low vision], Indians or Asians [poor functional disability, arthritis and diabetes]). Understanding these ethnic health disparities may help in developing better strategies to improve health across population groups.",0
"Comparing the burden of dental conditions to other health outcomes provides useful insight for public policy. We aimed to estimate quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) loss due to dental conditions in the US adult population. Social inequalities in QALE loss by dental conditions were also examined. Data from 3 cross-sectional waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES waves 2001 to 2002, 2003 to 2004, and 2011 to 2012) were pooled and analyzed. The average age of study participants ( n = 9,445) was 48.4 y. Disutility scores were derived from self-rated health and the numbers of physically unhealthy days, mentally unhealthy days, and days with activity limitation, employing a previously published algorithm. The associations between the disutility scores and the numbers of decayed teeth, missing teeth, and periodontitis were examined by multiple linear regression stratified by age groups (20-39, 40-59, and ≥60 y), adjusted for other covariates (age, sex, wave fixed effect, educational attainment, smoking, and diabetes). The QALE loss due to dental conditions at the age of 20 was estimated using life tables. Decayed and missing teeth, but not periodontitis, were associated with a larger disutility score. The coefficient for decayed teeth was larger among the older population, whereas that of missing teeth was smaller among them. The estimated QALE loss was 0.43 y (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-0.59), which reached 5.3% of QALE loss (8.15 y; 95% CI, 8.03-8.27) due to overall morbidity. There were clear social gradients in QALE loss by dental conditions across the life course, and people with high school or less education had 0.32 y larger QALE loss in total compared with people with college or more education. This study suggests that improvements in people's dental health may yield substantial gains in population health and well-being. The necessity of more comprehensive public health strategies is highlighted.",0

"Many studies have reported close relationships between oral and systemic health. We explored the association of the number of remaining teeth with medical costs and hospitalization duration in people aged 75 and 80 years.
Oral health examinations were carried out at dental clinics in 2014. Medical cost and hospitalization duration data for fiscal year 2015 were obtained from the Mie Prefecture health insurer. We analyzed the data of 4700 individuals who met our inclusion criteria: 2745 75-year-olds and 1955 80-year-olds. The effects of remaining tooth numbers on medical costs and hospitalization days were analyzed using a generalized linear model with log link adjustment for confounders.
Total medical costs for all diseases were significantly higher in those with 20-27, 10-19 and 1-9 teeth, and in edentulous older individuals, compared with those with 28 teeth. Outpatient medical costs for diabetes were significantly higher in those with 20-27 and 1-9 teeth. Inpatient medical costs for digestive cancers were significantly higher in those with 10-19 and 1-9 teeth, and in edentulous older individuals. Hospitalization for digestive cancer was significantly longer in those with 20-27, 10-19 and 1-9 teeth, and in edentulous older individuals, than in those with 28 teeth. The number of teeth as a continuous variable was significantly inversely associated with medical costs for cerebrovascular disease and digestive cancer, and hospitalization days for digestive cancer.
Small numbers of teeth were associated with higher medical costs and longer hospital stays for older Japanese. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2019; 19: 335-341.",0
"Handgrip strength provides a clinically validated marker of overall health and mortality risk. There are however, no multi-national population-based studies investigating the associations between handgrip strength, chronic physical conditions, and physical multimorbidity (i.e., ≥2 chronic conditions). We aimed to assess these associations among community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults using nationally representative data from six in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Cross-sectional, community-based data on individuals aged ≥50 years from the World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health were analyzed. Eleven chronic physical conditions (angina, arthritis, asthma, chronic back pain, chronic lung disease, diabetes, edentulism, hearing problems, hypertension, stroke, visual impairment) were assessed. Weak handgrip strength was defined as <30 kg for men and <20 kg for women. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted.
The final sample included 34,129 individuals (62.4 ± 16.0 years; 52.1% female). After adjustment for potential confounders, when compared to those with no chronic physical conditions, having 1, 2, 3, and ≥4 physical chronic conditions was associated with 1.22 (95%CI = 1.08-1.37), 1.29 (95%CI = 1.11-1.50), 1.41 (95%CI = 1.18-1.68), and 1.78 (95%CI = 1.46-2.18) times higher odds for weak handgrip strength. Similar associations were observed in the analyses stratified by age and sex. There was a moderate level of between-country heterogeneity in the association between weak handgrip strength and physical multimorbidity (Higgin's I
Weaker handgrip strength is associated with a range of chronic physical conditions and multimorbidity. Future research should seek to establish the predictive value of this inexpensive measure for clinical use.",0

"No studies have examined the associations between the numbers of teeth and sleep disturbance. Therefore, we examined the associations between the number of teeth and sleep duration in older people, considering the evidence linking fewer teeth and sleep apnoea through changes in jaw position.
For this study we used information from a sample of 23,444 cohort participants, randomly selected from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study 2010 (N = 169,215). The outcome variable was self-reported sleep duration (h/day), and the explanatory variable was self-reported number of teeth (0, 1-9, 10-19, ≥20). We treated age, sex, body mass index, educational attainment, annual equalized household income, depressive symptoms, physical activity, activities of daily living, presence of diabetes, and smoking status as covariates. Multinomial logistic regression was used among the 20,548 eligible participants with all necessary information.
The mean age was 73.7 (standard deviation = 6.13) years. Most participants (28.1%) reported sleep duration of 7 h, while a small proportion of the participants reported short (≤4 h, 2.7%) or long (≥10 h, 4.7%) sleep duration. The proportion of edentulous participants was 14.7%. Taking the 7-h sleep duration as the reference category, edentulous participants (relative risk ratio (RRR) = 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07-1.90) or one to nine teeth (RRR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.02-1.63) had a significantly higher relative risk ratio for short sleep, independent of covariates. Furthermore, they had a higher relative risk ratio for long sleep duration (RRR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.40-2.19; RRR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.21-1.81, respectively).
Compared to people with 20 or more teeth, older adults with fewer than 10 teeth have higher risks for short and long sleep durations.",0
"There is little evidence on the potential health benefits of active travel in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The aim of this study was to assess the association between levels of active travel and physical multi-morbidity (i.e., two or more chronic physical conditions) and individual physical conditions among community-dwelling adults aged 65 or older in six LMICs.
Data were analyzed from the World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa). Active travel (minutes / week) was assessed with questions of the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) and presented in tertiles. Eleven chronic conditions (angina, arthritis, asthma, chronic back pain, chronic lung disease, diabetes, edentulism, hearing problems, hypertension, stroke, visual impairment) were assessed by self-report of diagnosis, symptoms, or blood pressure measurement. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between levels of active travel, physical conditions and physical multi-morbidity.
The final sample consisted of 14,585 individuals aged ≥65 years (mean age = 72.6±0.1 years; 54.9% female). In the fully adjusted model, compared to the highest tertile, those in the lowest tertile of active travel had a 1.28 (95%CI = 1.06-1.54) times higher odds for physical multi-morbidity. The association between active travel and physical multi-morbidity was significantly mediated by affect (14.4%) and cognition (9.7%). With regard to individual conditions, hearing problems, hypertension, stroke, and visual impairment were particularly strongly associated with less active travel.
The current data suggest that lower levels of active travel are associated with the presence of physical health conditions and physical multi-morbidity. This multi-national study offers potentially valuable insight for a number of hypotheses which may influence this relationship, although testing with longitudinal studies is needed.",0
"To study whether periodontal condition is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
A population-based follow-up study was conducted among persons born in 1935 and living in the city of Oulu, Finland (n = 395). The baseline examinations were done during 1990-1992, and the follow-up examinations were done during 2007-2008. The data were gathered by questionnaires, laboratory tests and clinical measurements. Poisson regression models were used in the data analyses.
The adjusted rate ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the incident T2DM among subjects with 4-5 mm deep periodontal pockets (n = 98), among subjects with 6 mm deep or deeper periodontal pockets (n = 91), and among edentulous subjects (n = 118) were 1.32 (95% CI: 0.69-2.53), 1.56 (95% CI: 0.84-2.92) and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.53-1.89), respectively, compared to dentate subjects without deepened (4 mm deep or deeper) periodontal pockets (n = 88). The adjusted RR per site (the number of sites with deepened periodontal pockets as a continuous variable) was 1.02 (95% CI: 1.00-1.04).
Poor periodontal condition may be a predictor of the development of T2DM. However, the causality between periodontal condition and the development of T2DM remains uncertain.",0
"Dental implants are the preferred treatment modality in the present edentulous era. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have detrimental effect on bone density. The present study was conducted to determine the effect of SSRIs on the success rate of dental implants.
The present study was conducted on 352 patients of both genders with 680 dental implants. History of depression and SSRI medication was retrieved. Patients were divided into two groups. Group I (110 patients, 230 dental implants) patients were on SSRI, while group II (242 patients, 450 dental implants) patients were non-SSRI. In all patients, the implant failure rate was recorded.
In group I, 35 patients were >50 years, while 75 were <50 years of age. In group II, 60 patients were >50 years, while 182 were <50 years of age. The difference was significant (p < 0.05). Group I had 45 males and 65 females, while group II comprised of 105 males and 137 females. Group I showed 25 implant failures and group II had 21 implant failures. Age group >50 years showed 12 implant failures while <50 years had 13 in group I compared with 10 in patients >50 years and 11 in patients with <50 years of age; 56% smokers had implant in group I as compared with 60% failure in group II. In group I, 27% diabetic patients had failures as compared with 13.4% in group II. The difference was significant (p < 0.05). Group I showed maximum failures in terms of loosening of screw (8) followed by fracture of implant (7), peri-implantitis (6), and fracture of screw (4), whereas in group II, 7 cases were of loosening of screw, 6 cases were of fracture of screw, 5 cases of fracture of implant, and 3 cases of peri-implantitis. The difference was nonsignificant (p > 0.05).
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors cause increased osteoclastic activity, leading to bone loss and implants placed in patients with history of depression are more prone to failures.
Failure rates of dental implants are significantly increased in patients taking SSRIs due to depression. Careful case analysis and history of depression may minimize the failure rates.",0
"The aim of the study was to assess dental status of Polish seniors having and wearing dentures in relation to demographic, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors.
Tooth loss is associated with deterioration of general health status. The epidemiological data on dental status in Poland, including Polish seniors, are fragmented.
The study cohort consisted of 4524 randomly selected participants, aged 65 years and over, representative for Polish seniors. Demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle factors and dental status were collected using standardised questionnaires.
The prevalence of partial and complete edentulism in the Polish senior population was estimated at 45.7% and 47.1%, respectively. Fourteen point four per cent (14.4%) of complete edentulous participants and 31.1% with partial edentulism (1-19 natural teeth) did not have dentures, and one-twelfth of respondents having dentures were not wearing them. The independent correlates of complete edentulism were: female sex, advanced age, rural dwelling, lower education level, physical work in the past, smoking and diabetes. Male sex, age 90+, rural dwelling, type of work, dependence in activities of daily living and partial edentulism were independent correlates of not having dentures and denture disuse. Lower than average personal income was only significant for not having dentures.
Complete edentulism is frequent among older Poles and affects almost 50% of them. It is associated with female sex, age, rural dwelling, poor economic status, smoking and diabetes. Rural dwelling and dependence of daily living are significant correlates of not having dentures and denture disuse.",0
"Little information exists about the loss of all one's teeth (edentulism) among older adults in Indonesia. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of edentulism and associated factors among older adults in Indonesia.
This study examines the self-reported prevalence of edentulism and associated factors among older adults (50 years and older) in a cross-sectional national study using the Indonesia Family Life Survey IFLS-5, 2014/15. The community-based study uses a multi-stage stratified sampling design to interview and assess household members, with a household response rate of over 90%.
The overall prevalence of edentulism was 7.2, 29.8% in 80 years and older and 11.8% in those with no formal education. In adjusted Poisson regression analysis, older age, living in five major island groups and having functional disability were associated with edentulism. In addition, among men, having quit and current tobacco use and among women, having low social capital were associated with edentulism. Further, in adjusted analysis, among men, edentulism was positively associated with hypertension and negatively associated with diabetes, and among women, edentulism was associated with functional disability.
Results suggest that overall and/or among men or women that older age, living in five major island groups, having functional disability, tobacco quitters and users and those with low social capital was associated with edentulism. The identified associated factors of edentulism may be utilized in oral health programmes targeting older adults in Indonesia.",0
"Although associations between oral health and pneumonia have been reported in previous studies, particularly in the institutionalized elderly, few prospective studies have investigated the association between oral condition and pneumonia among community-dwelling people and whether the findings among inpatients or patients in nursing homes are applicable to the general population is still unclear. The oral bacteria propagated in the periodontal regions may drop into the lung and increase the risk of pneumonia. We, therefore, investigated the association of tooth loss with mortality from pneumonia in a cohort study of Japanese dentists. Members of the Japan Dental Association (JDA) participated in the LEMONADE (Longitudinal Evaluation of Multi-phasic, Odontological and Nutritional Associations in Dentists) Study. From 2001 to 2006, they completed a baseline questionnaire on lifestyle and health factors including the number of teeth lost (excluding third molars). We followed 19,775 participants (mean age ± standard deviation, 51.4 ± 11.7 years; 1,573 women [8.0%] and 18,202 men [92.0%]) for mortality from pneumonia (ICD-10, J12-J18). Mortality data were collected via the fraternal insurance program of the JDA. The hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with adjustment for sex, age, body mass index, smoking status, physical activity and diabetes history. During the median follow-up period of 9.5 years, we documented 68 deaths from pneumonia. Participants who were edentulous at baseline were at significantly increased risk of mortality from pneumonia. The multivariable-adjusted HRs were 2.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-3.95) for the edentulous and 1.60 (95% CI, 0.83-3.10) for loss of 15-27 teeth relative to loss of 0-14 teeth (trend p = 0.026). The HR per one tooth loss was also significant; 1.031 (95% CI, 1.004-1.060). In conclusion, a large number of teeth lost may indicate an increased risk of mortality from pneumonia in community-dwelling populations.",0
"To compare the glycemic control in non-smoking patients with type 2 diabetes according to their periodontal and dental status.
This cross-sectional study investigated patients previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and under antidiabetic medication. Clinical data and fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were collected from medical and dental records. Patients were divided into three groups according to dental and periodontal diagnosis: no or mild periodontitis (NO/MILD, n=96), moderate or severe periodontitis (MOD/SEV, n=74) and edentulous (n=141). FBG levels were compared between groups. Logistic regression was also applied to estimate the OR of presenting hyperglycemia.
Edentulous patients had significantly higher FBG levels of 155.7±70.9 (mean±SD mg/dL) than those in the MOD/SEV (136.6±33.8) and the NO/MILD (123.1±36.7) groups. Differences between the latter two groups were also significant. Edentulous patients had adjusted ORs of 4.53, 4.27 and 3.95 of having FBG≥126, ≥150 and ≥180 mg/dL, respectively, in comparison with NO/MILD group. The MOD/SEV group also presented significant odds of having FBG≥126 mg/dL (OR=2.66) and ≥150 mg/dL (OR=2.45) than the NO/MILD group.
Patients in the MOD/SEV group had worse glycemic control than the ones in the NO/MILD group. However, edentulous patients presented higher glycemic levels than both dentate groups, and also presented with higher odds of having hyperglycemia.",0
"This research aimed to assess the oral health related to quality of life among hypertensive and diabetic patients in the city of Alfenas, Brazil. This was a domiciliary-based, descriptive-analytical, cross-sectional research with a random, systematic sample stratified by the Family Health Team, consisting of 218 individuals. The following indexes were applied: DMFT, T-Health, FS-T, SiC index, use and need of prosthesis and OHIP-14. Most of the patients (56.42%) had only high blood pressure, were females (67.43%), with an average age of 64.83 (±11.99) years old, varying between 35 and 93 years old. No significant differences on the variables between hypertensives, diabetics and hypertensive-diabetics were noticed. The following data was registered: DMFT=27.16 (± 6.15), with 22.94 (± 10.46) of missing teeth; T-Health=5.23 (± 6.52); FS-T=8.53 (± 10.12) and SiC=32 (± 0.00). 85.78% of the individuals were using prosthesis (58.72% Dentures) and 61.01% needed prostheses (58.26% in the jaw).The correlations between OHIP-14 (5.37 [± 4.95]) and oral health evidenced the increase in the number of teeth affecting psychological dimensions, besides the use and need of prostheses were associated to physical and social impacts (p < 0.05). We concluded that edentulism, use and need of prostheses affected quality of life in hypertensive and diabetic patients concerning psychological, physical and social aspects.
O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a qualidade de vida relacionada às condições clínicas de saúde bucal entre hipertensos e diabéticos de Alfenas, MG, Brasil. Estudo domiciliar, descritivo-analítico, transversal, com amostra randomizada, sistemática, estratificada por Equipe Saúde da Família, composta por 218 sujeitos. Aplicou-se os índices CPOD, T-Health, FS-T, SiC index, uso e necessidade de próteses e OHIP-14. A maioria dos sujeitos (56,42%) apresenta apenas Hipertensão Arterial, é do sexo feminino (67,43%), com idade média de 64,83 (± 11,99), variando entre 35 e 93 anos. Não se observou diferenças significativas para as variáveis entre hipertensos, diabéticos e hipertensos-diabéticos. Registrou-se CPOD = 27,16 (± 6,15), com 22,94 (± 10,46) dentes perdidos; T-Health = 5,23 (± 6,52); FS-T = 8,53 (± 10,12) e SiC = 32 (± 0,00). Dos sujeitos, 85,78% usavam próteses (58,72% Prótese Total) e 61,01% necessitavam das mesmas (58,26% no arco inferior). As correlações entre OHIP-14 (5,37 [± 4,95]) e condições clínicas evidenciaram a presença de dentes afetando dimensões psicológicas, além de uso e necessidade de próteses associadas a impactos físicos e sociais (p < 0,05). Concluiu-se que edentulismo, uso e necessidade de próteses afetaram a qualidade de vida de hipertensos e diabéticos em aspectos psicológicos, físicos e sociais.",0
"The objective of this study was to assess whether long-term implant survival rates and bone loss in patients with moderately controlled type 2 diabetes is similar to the rates reported in the nondiabetic population.
This retrospective observational study utilized patient medical records from a general practitioner's dental office. The records of patients who had moderately controlled type 2 diabetes with hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) up to 8% and glucose level below 150 mg/dL were reviewed, as patients with HbA1c up to 7% are considered to be well-controlled type 2 diabetes. Follow-up data were recorded and analyzed. Inclusion criteria were as follows: partially edentulous patients with missing teeth who were subsequently treated with implant-supported prosthetic restorations; patients were at least 18 years of age and demonstrated the ability to maintain oral hygiene. Exclusion criteria were as follows: patients did not present for annual follow-up visits; patients presented with a neglected periodontal status; patient records had incomplete surgical or restorative data or nondiagnostic radiographs; implants with external hexagonal and machined surfaces. All the restorations were cement-retained. Three different implant insertion/placement methods were used: (1) implants immediately inserted following tooth extraction; (2) implants inserted 6 to 8 weeks after tooth extraction to allow for primary healing; and (3) implants inserted 4 to 6 months after tooth extraction.
After review of more than 3,256 medical records, 169 patients were identified (with 1,112 implants) who met the inclusion criteria. The mean follow-up time was 8.7 years, with a minimum of 4.9 years. Sixty-seven implants failed, yielding a 94% overall implant survival rate. The overall mean bone loss around the implants was 1.98 (± 1.81) mm. Comparable to data published earlier, no statistical significance in survival rate was found between the nondiabetic and diabetic population. The delayed insertion protocol presented the least bone loss, compared with immediate insertion (P = .06), and compared with early insertion (P = .046).
The results show that implant survival and bone loss levels were comparable to reported outcomes in the nondiabetic population. The delayed insertion protocol presented less bone loss compared with other insertion methods. Likewise, less bone loss was found in implants placed in the posterior region.",0
"No studies have reported the association between the number of teeth and hypertension in the Korean national data. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the number of teeth is associated with blood pressure and hypertension in a representative sample of the Korean population.
A cross-sectional study was conducted on 13,561 participants aged ≥19 years using the 2012 to 2014 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. The number of teeth was divided into four groups: 0, 1 to 19, 20 to -27, and 28. The definition of hypertension was systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg or being medicated for hypertension. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed after controlling for age, sex, income, education, smoking, drinking, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia. Age- and sex-stratified analyses were performed.
The fully adjusted odds ratios (AOR) of the number of teeth group for hypertension were as follows: AOR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.43 for 20 to 27 teeth; AOR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.76; 1 to 19 teeth; and AOR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.22 to 2.18 for edentulism. The strength of the association was highest in women aged ≥60 years across all age and sex groups (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.15 to 2.86).
Findings suggest that a decrease in the number of teeth may be independently associated with hypertension in the Korean population.",0
"To assess the association between chronic physical conditions and multimorbidity and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Nationally representative, cross-sectional, community-based study.
Six countries that participated in the World Health Organization Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health.
Individuals aged 50 and older (N=32,715; mean age 62.1 ± 15.6; 51.7% female).
The definition of MCI was based on the recommendations of the National Institute on Ageing and Alzheimer's Association. Ten chronic conditions were assessed (angina pectoris, arthritis, asthma, cataract, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, edentulism, hearing problems, hypertension, stroke). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between chronic physical conditions, multimorbidity (≥2 chronic conditions), and MCI.
The prevalence of multimorbidity was 49.8% (95% confidence interval (CI)=48.1-51.5%) and of MCI was 15.3% (95% CI=14.4-16.3%). After adjustment for potential confounders, edentulism (odds ratio (OR)=1.24), arthritis (OR=1.24), chronic lung disease (OR=1.29), cataract (OR=1.33), stroke (OR=1.94), hearing problems (OR=2.27), and multimorbidity (OR=1.40) were significantly associated with MCI. There was a gradual increase in the likelihood of MCI (1 condition: OR=1.21, 95% CI=1.03-1.42; ≥4 conditions: OR=2.07, 95% CI=1.70-2.52).
These results highlight the need to investigate the underlying mechanisms linking chronic conditions and MCI and whether prevention or treatment of chronic conditions or multimorbidity can reduce the onset of cognitive decline and subsequent dementia, especially in LMICs.",0
"Spiral dental implant (SDI) is an implant with a conical internal helix that confers the characteristic of self-drilling, self-tapping, and self-bone condensing. These proprieties offer better control during insertion of SDI giving a high primary stabilization, even in poor quality bone. A shorter diameter of SDI results in reduced drilling during insertion and consequently less trauma and minimal bone loss. To address the research purpose, the investigators designed a retrospective cohort study. The study population was composed of 25 patients, 11 males and 14 females that have been treated by Dr. Balan with 187 SDI positioned in mandible and into maxilla bone. The implants were placed during the years 2013 to 2014 in Dr. Balan clinic. All patients underwent the same surgical protocol. Several variables are investigated: demographic (age and gender), anatomic (upper/lower jaws and tooth site), implant (length and diameter and type) variables, edentulism (partial or total), and comorbid status of health (i.e.: hypothyroidism, parodontitis, hypertension, diabetes, presence of cancer, heart disease, hepatitis and rheumatologic disease). Pearson Chi-Square test was used to investigate variables and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistically it has been shown that females have a higher possibility of unsuccessful respect of male, with a ""p value"" of 0.014. Another important impact factor for success of implant insertion has been represented by concomitants pathologies: cancer represents the most negative high factor risk with a percentage of unsuccessful of 50%, followed by heart disease (15%), and diabetes (3.7%). SDIs are reliable tools for difficult cases of oral rehabilitation. They have a higher success and survival rate, which means stable results over time. No differences were detected among SDI lengths, implant/crown ratio. In addition, the insertion of SDIs in banked bone can be performed without adverse effects. Finally, flapless and computer tomography-planned surgery does not significantly increase the clinical outcome of SDIs in complex rehabilitation. Cancer represents the most important variable to consider when a patient wants to do oral rehabilitation because of its high risk of unsuccessful.",0
"To investigate the associations between objective and subjective measures of oral health and incident physical frailty.
Cross-sectional and longitudinal study with 3 years of follow-up using data from the British Regional Heart Study.
General practices in 24 British towns.
Community-dwelling men aged 71 to 92 (N = 1,622).
Objective assessments of oral health included tooth count and periodontal disease. Self-reported oral health measures included overall self-rated oral health; dry mouth symptoms; sensitivity to hot, cold, and sweet; and perceived difficulty eating. Frailty was defined using the Fried phenotype as having 3 or more of weight loss, grip strength, exhaustion, slow walking speed, and low physical activity. Incident frailty was assessed after 3 years of follow-up in 2014.
Three hundred three (19%) men were frail at baseline (aged 71-92). Having fewer than 21 teeth, complete tooth loss, fair to poor self-rated oral health, difficulty eating, dry mouth, and more oral health problems were associated with greater likelihood of being frail. Of 1,284 men followed for 3 years, 107 (10%) became frail. The risk of incident frailty was higher in participants who were edentulous (odds ratio (OR) = 1.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-3.52); had 3 or more dry mouth symptoms (OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.18-3.48); and had 1 (OR = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.18-4.64), 2 (OR = 2.30, 95% CI = 1.09-4.84), or 3 or more (OR = 2.72, 95% CI = 1.11-6.64) oral health problems after adjustment for age, smoking, social class, history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus, and medications related to dry mouth.
The presence of oral health problems was associated with greater risks of being frail and developing frailty in older age. The identification and management of poor oral health in older people could be important in preventing frailty.",0
"Objective Tooth loss is an irreversible condition that reflects the end-stage of oral diseases, including periodontitis. Although periodontitis is a major factor in the progression of diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), no previous studies have compared tooth loss in CVD patients with and without DM. Methods The subjects included CVD patients with (n=94) and without (n=145) DM who attended Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital. Blood examinations and periodontal measurements were performed. Results The oral and periodontal examinations revealed that the numbers of missing teeth in the DM group were increased in comparison to the non-DM group. There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to the incidence of edentulism, the probing pocket depth, the clinical attachment level or the incidence of bleeding on probing. Conclusion We showed that the numbers of missing teeth among CVD patients with DM was significantly higher than that among CVD patients without DM.",0
"It is well known that there is a strong relationship between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Tooth loss reflects an end-stage condition of oral diseases, such as periodontitis. Infection with specific periodontal pathogens is known as a possible factor that influences development of CVD. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the number of residual teeth and systemic inflammatory conditions in patients with CVD.
We divided 364 patients with CVD into four groups, according to the number of residual teeth: (i) ≥20 teeth; (ii) 10-19 teeth; (iii) 1-9 teeth; and (iv) edentulous. We recorded medical history, blood data and periodontal conditions. Serum samples were obtained and their IgG titers against three major periodontal pathogens were measured.
Smoking rate and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus were higher in edentulous patients and in subjects with a few teeth compared with patients with many teeth. The levels of C-reactive protein were higher in patients with 1-9 teeth than in those with 10-19 teeth and with ≥20 teeth. The level of Porphyromonas gingivalis IgG in the group with 10-19 teeth was statistically higher than that in the group with ≥20 teeth. The level of P. gingivalis IgG in the edentulous group tended to be lower than that in the other groups.
The patients with 1-9 teeth had the highest level of C-reactive protein among the four groups, and the patients with 10-19 teeth had the highest level of IgG to periodontal bacteria. We conclude that the number of remaining teeth may be used to estimate the severity of systemic inflammation in patients with CVD.",0
"Sedentary behavior (SB) is, irrespective of a person's physical activity levels, associated with a wide range of deleterious outcomes such as diabetes, stroke and associated premature mortality. There are no nationally representative, multi-national, population-based studies investigating the relationship between SB, chronic conditions, and physical multimorbidity (i.e., two or more chronic physical conditions). Thus, this cross-sectional study aimed to assess the association between chronic conditions, physical multimorbidity and SB among community-dwelling adults in six low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We also explored the influential factors of these relationships.
The Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) survey included 34,129 adults aged ≥50 years. SB was self-reported and expressed as a categorical variable [<8 or ≥8 h per day (high SB)]. Eleven chronic physical conditions (angina, arthritis, asthma, chronic back pain, chronic lung disease, diabetes, edentulism, hearing problems, hypertension, stroke, visual impairment) were assessed. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analyses were conducted.
The prevalence of physical multimorbidity and high SB (≥8 h/day) were 45.5% (43.7%-47.4%) and 10.8% (9.7%-12.1%), respectively. The prevalence of high SB increased in a linear fashion from 7.1% in people with no chronic condition to 24.1% in those with ≥4 chronic conditions. In the multivariable analysis, visual impairment (OR = 2.62), stroke (OR = 2.02), chronic back pain (OR = 1.70) hearing problems (OR = 1.58), chronic lung disease (OR = 1.48), asthma (OR = 1.39), arthritis (OR = 1.22) and multimorbidity (OR = 1.41) were significantly associated with high SB. Disability explained more than 50% of the association for all chronic conditions with particularly high percentages (>80%) for arthritis, asthma, and multimorbdity. Mobility problems explained 88.1% and 85.1% of the association of SB with arthritis and physical multimorbidiy, respectively. Pain was highly influential in the SB-arthritis relationship (85.6%). Sleep/energy problems explained between 9.3% (stroke) to 49.1% (arthritis) of the association, and cognitive problems from 21.5% (stroke) to 33.4% (hearing problems). Findings for anxiety and depression were mixed.
In LMICs, those with chronic conditions and physical multimorbidity are significantly more sedentary. Targeted messages to reduce time spent sedentary among individuals with chronic conditions may ameliorate associated disability, mobility difficulties and pain that are themselves the most important risk factors for SB.",0
"The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate clinical outcomes of implant treatment in periodontally compromised patients.
Partially edentulous patients who were diagnosed and treated for chronic periodontitis and later rehabilitated with implant-supported single crowns or fixed partial dentures were enrolled in this study. At the final follow-up, data on probing pocket depth and bleeding on probing were collected, and changes in peri-implant bone levels were assessed on periapical radiographs. Accordingly, patients were categorized into peri-implant disease-free (PID-free), peri-implant mucositis (PIM), or peri-implantitis (PI) groups. Additionally, information on the history of systemic diseases was obtained and correlated with the findings.
Seven females and six males with a mean age of 55.2 (standard deviation [SD] ± 8.38) years were included in this study. Fifty-five implants were placed in 13 partially edentulous patients with a history of chronic periodontitis. The mean follow-up in the study was 35.1 (SD ± 2.40) months. No implants were lost in the 13 patients, for a cumulative survival of 100%. PI was confirmed in 3 patients and PIM in 8 patients, while 2 patients were found to be PID-free. Diabetes and hypertension were found to be the predominant systemic factors among patients affected by peri-implant diseases.
Patients with a history of periodontitis are at considerable risk of being affected by peri-implant mucositis, if not by peri-implantitis.",0
"The health care environment in the U.S. is changing. The population is aging, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is increasing, edentulism is decreasing, and periodontal infection/inflammation has been identified as a risk factor for NCDs. These trends offer an opportunity for oral health care providers to broaden the scope of traditional dental practice, specifically becoming more involved in the management of the general health of patients. This new practice paradigm will promote a closer integration with the larger health care system. This change is based on the realization that a healthy mouth is essential for a healthy life, including proper mastication, communication, esthetics, and comfort. Two types of primary care are proposed: screenings for medical conditions that are directly affected by oral disease (and may modify the provision of dental care), and a broader emphasis on prevention that focuses on lifestyle behaviors. Included in the former category are screenings for NCDs (e.g., the risk of cardiovascular disease and identification of patients with undiagnosed dysglycemia or poorly managed diabetes mellitus), as well as identification of infectious diseases, such as HIV or hepatitis C. Reducing the risk of disease can be accomplished by an emphasis on smoking cessation and dietary intake and the prevention of obesity. These activities will promote interprofessional health care education and practice. While change is always challenging, this new practice paradigm could improve both oral health and health outcomes of patients seen in the dental office.

"To determine prevalence and factors predictive of periodontitis by using a standardized assessment model in adults with type 2 diabetes.
We performed an observational cross-sectional study to determine the burden of periodontitis in adults with type 2 diabetes attending urban, ambulatory referral centers in the USA and UK. Full-mouth probing was performed and periodontitis was diagnosed based on either a low (≥5 mm at ≥1 site) or high pocket probing-depth threshold (≥6 mm at ≥1 site). Results were stratified into a five-stage schema and integrated with other clinical variables into the novel Diabetes Cross-Disciplinary Index to function as a balanced health scorecard. Corresponding demographic and routinely collected health data were obtained and comparisons were made between patients with and without periodontitis. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors predictive of the presence or absence of periodontitis.
Between our two cohorts, 253 patients were screened. Caucasians comprised >90% and Hispanic Americans >75% of the UK and US cohorts, respectively. Males and females were equally distributed; mean age was 53.6±11 years; and 17 (6.7%) were edentulous. Of the 236 dentate patients, 128 (54.2%) had periodontitis by low threshold and 57 (24.2%) by high threshold. Just 17 (7.2%) were periodontally healthy. No significant differences in age, HbA1c, blood pressure, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or smoking status (all p>0.05) were identified between those with or without periodontitis (regardless of threshold) and none was found to be a significant predictor of disease.
Periodontitis is frequent in adults with type 2 diabetes and all should be screened. Periodontal health status can be visualized with other comorbidities and complications using a novel balanced scorecard that could facilitate patient-clinician communication, shared decision-making, and prioritization of individual healthcare needs.",0
"In this study, we assessed the association of chronic medical conditions and multimorbidity with perceived stress among community-dwelling adults in 44 low- and middle-income countries. Data from the World Health Survey (2002-2004), including 229,293 adults, were analyzed. A perceived stress score (range, 0 (lowest stress)-100 (highest stress)) was computed on the basis of 2 questions from the Perceived Stress Scale. Eleven chronic conditions were assessed. Multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted to explore the associations. All chronic conditions were associated with significantly higher mean perceived stress scores, with the exception of edentulism. The associations were particularly strong for depression (β = 14.71, 95% confidence interval (CI): 13.68, 15.74), visual impairment (β = 10.66, 95% CI: 8.09, 13.23), and schizophrenia (β = 9.98, 95% CI: 7.71, 12.24). Compared with no chronic conditions, the β coefficients for perceived stress with the presence of 1, 2, 3, and ≥4 chronic conditions were 5.58 (95% CI: 4.94, 6.23), 9.58 (95% CI: 8.67, 10.49), 14.15 (95% CI: 12.63, 15.67), and 20.17 (95% CI: 18.29, 22.05), respectively. The associations with perceived stress were significantly stronger among the poorest individuals for arthritis, asthma, diabetes, edentulism, and ≥4 chronic conditions. Our data suggest that a range of chronic conditions and multimorbidity are associated with greatly increased perceived stress among people in low- and middle-income countries, and that the poorest persons may be a particularly vulnerable group.",0
"Contradictory results exist regarding influence of apico-coronal implant placement on crestal bone levels.
Complete charts of patients ≥18 years old with one or more dental implants were included. Demographic, medical, surgical, and prosthetic information was recorded. Implant bone levels were evaluated at initial placement, implant uncovery, prosthetic delivery, and 3 to 6, 7 to 11, and 12 to 18 months post-implant placement.
Charts of 55 patients and 134 implants were included. At baseline, 19.5%, 67.3%, and 13.3% of implants were recorded as equicrestal, subcrestal, and supracrestal, respectively, on their mesial aspect, and 32.1%, 50.0%, and 17.9% on their distal aspect, respectively. At time of prosthetic delivery, mesial aspect implant position was equicrestal in 35.4%, subcrestal in 17.7%, and supracrestal in 46.9% of cases, whereas on their distal aspects, the same categorical positions were found in 28.4%, 21.1%, and 50.5% of implants. For the mesial aspect of the implant, 3- to 6-, 7- to 11-, and 12- to 18-month intervals, and for the distal aspect of the implant, 7- to 11- and 12- to 18-month intervals, along with diabetes (for both mesial and distal), were associated with a statistically more apical position of the bone compared with baseline. Although the odds ratio of a subcrestal implant position at follow-up times was statistically greater for implants located subcrestally at surgery, linear measures of differential crestal bone loss (CBL) as a function of the categorical initial placement of the implant (supracrestal, equicrestal, subcrestal) at 3- to 6-, 7- to 11-, and 12- to 18-month time points generally showed no significant differences among groups.
A subcrestal position of the implant at time of surgery leads to reduced odds of having implant threads exposed; however, it is associated with similar linear CBL compared with an equicrestal or supracrestal surgical position.",0
"Few studies have reported associations between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in older women, which is the objective of the present investigation.
Participants were 57 001 postmenopausal women ages 55 to 89 years (mean 68 years; >85% 60 and older) who were enrolled (1993-1998) in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, and were without known CVD when history of periodontitis and edentulism was assessed by questionnaire at study Year-5 (1998-2003). There were 3589 incident CVD events and 3816 total deaths during a mean follow-up of 6.7 years. In multivariable analysis, periodontitis was not associated with CVD events, but was associated with higher total mortality (hazard ratio (HR)=1.12, 95% CI: 1.05-1.21). Edentulism was associated with higher age- and smoking-adjusted risks of CVD (HR=1.42, 95% CI: 1.27-1.59) and mortality (HR=1.47, 95% CI: 1.32-1.63). Further adjustment eliminated the association with CVD, but mortality remained significantly increased (HR=1.17, 95% CI: 1.02-1.33). Stratification on age, race-ethnicity, smoking, and diabetes mellitus yielded comparable results; however, edentulism was more strongly associated with CVD in women reporting ≥1 dental visit (HR=1.57) compared with <1 visit (HR 1.03, interaction 
In community-dwelling older women, edentulism was associated with increased risks of CVD and total mortality, and presence of periodontitis, which is more prevalent than edentulism, was associated with 17% higher mortality rate. These findings suggest that improving periodontal condition of the general population could reduce overall mortality.",0
"To investigate the relationship of radiographic evidence of root filled teeth to cardiovascular outcomes.
Baseline data for 506 subjects including 256 angiographically verified heart disease patients and 250 matched cardiologically healthy controls participating in the Kuopio Oral Health and Heart study were collected in 1995-1996. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortalities were accrued until 31 May 2015 and appended to the baseline data. Mortality status data were obtained from the Finnish National Death Register where all mortality cases and the causes of death are compiled for all Finnish citizens. Of the 506 participants, 473 subjects who had no missing values in the predictor, outcome or confounding factors were included in the analyses to assess the relationship of radiographic evidence of root filled teeth with prevalent coronary artery disease (CAD) cross sectionally and also with CVD mortality longitudinally. Multivariable logistic regression was used for the cross-sectional part and proportional hazard regression analyses for the longitudinal part of the study were used adjusting for age, sex, smoking, edentulism, diabetes, hypertension, total/HDL cholesterol ratio and income. Additionally, whether this association was independent of periodontitis, and a systemic marker of inflammation, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was examined.
Having ≥1 root filled teeth was associated with 84% lower odds of prevalent CAD with Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09-0.28, P < 0.0001. The OR for edentulism was 1.32 (CI: 0.73-2.38), P = 0.36, suggesting a nonsignificant increase in risk. Prospectively, having at least one root filled teeth was associated with a 49% lower risk of CVD mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.51, CI = 0.27-0.97, P = 0.04) whilst edentulism was associated with nonsignificantly increased risk for CVD mortality: HR = 1.25 (CI: 0.65-2.42), P = 0.36. Adjustment for periodontitis or serum CRP levels changed the OR or HR slightly but the associations remained significant.
Having ≥1 root filled teeth was associated with significantly lower odds for prevalent CAD cross sectionally and lower risk of cardiovascular mortality prospectively. These reduced associations with CVD were independent of periodontitis or serum CRP levels.",0
"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common disease worldwide. Patients with DM have an increased risk of losing their teeth compared with other individuals. Dental implants are a standard of care for treating partial or full edentulism, and various implant surface treatments have recently been developed to increase dental implant stability. However, some studies have reported that DM reduces osseointegration and the success rate of dental implants. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of high glucose levels for hard tissue formation on a nano-scale modified titanium surface.
Titanium disks were heated at 600°C for 1 h after treatment with or without 10 m NaOH solution. All disks were incubated with type II DM rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells before exposure to one of four concentrations of glucose (5.5, 8.0, 12.0 or 24.0 mm). The effect of different glucose concentrations on bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell osteogenesis and inflammatory cytokines on the nano-scale modified titanium surface was evaluated.
Alkaline phosphatase activity decreased with increasing glucose concentration. In contrast, osteocalcin production and calcium deposition were significantly decreased at 8.0 mm glucose, but increased with glucose concentrations over 8.0 mm. Differences in calcium/phosphate ratio associated with the various glucose concentrations were similar to osteocalcin production and calcium deposition. Inflammatory cytokines were expressed at high glucose concentrations, but the nano-scale modified titanium surface inhibited the effect of high glucose concentrations.
High glucose concentration increased hard tissue formation, but the quality of the mineralized tissue decreased. Furthermore, the nano-scale modified titanium surface increased mineralized tissue formation and anti-inflammation, but the quality of hard tissue was dependent on glucose concentration.",0
"This cross-sectional study assessed the association of chronic physical conditions and multimorbidity with anxiety among community-dwelling adults in 42 countries.
Data were analyzed from the World Health Survey including 181,845 adults aged ≥18years. Anxiety in the past 30days and nine chronic physical conditions (angina, arthritis, asthma, chronic back pain, diabetes, edentulism, hearing problem, tuberculosis, and visual impairment) were assessed. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore the associations between chronic physical conditions or the number of them and anxiety.
After adjustment for confounders, most of the individual chronic physical conditions were significantly associated with anxiety. Compared to those with no physical health conditions, one condition was associated with an almost twofold increased odds of anxiety symptoms (OR=1.94; 95%CI=1.76-2.13), while this figure rose to 5.49 (3.73-8.09) in those with ≥5 conditions.
Our data suggest that increasing numbers of chronic physical conditions are associated with higher odds for anxiety. Health care providers should consider the presence of anxiety symptoms especially in individuals with physical multimorbidity.",0
"The main purpose of this study was to investigate factors affecting dental care utilization among nursing home residents in Jordan.
A total of 221 subjects with a mean age of 62.4 years (121 males and 100 females) taken from among nursing home residents across Jordan were recruited and composed a convenience sample for this study. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Tinetti Assessment Battery for gait and balance (TAB), Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand test (DASH) were administered and oral health status was assessed for all subjects and examined as expected correlates of dental care utilization among nursing home residents.
The response rate was about 88%. One-third of residents suffered from total edentulism and most of the remaining dentate residents exhibited periodontal disease (90%). Of the dentate sample, 90% of residents had bleeding upon probing, 85% were diagnosed with tooth mobility, 88% had presence of dental calculus, and 30% were diagnosed with root caries. Of the denture wearers, 59.1 % reported having soreness with their dentures and 32% of denture wearers reported having poor quality dentures. MMSE score, suffering from tooth sensitivity and having diabetes mellitus were identified to be indicators for utilization of dental care services among the study population.
Regular oral care, assessments, and rehabilitation services are considered to be limited for nursing home residents in Jordan. Based upon these findings, future interventions should address oral health among nursing home residents in Jordan.",0
"There are no nationally representative population-based studies investigating the relationship between physical activity, chronic conditions and multimorbidity (i.e., two or more chronic conditions) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and studies on a multi-national level are lacking. This is an important research gap, given the rapid increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases associated with lifestyle changes in these countries. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the association between chronic conditions, multimorbidity and low physical activity (PA) among community-dwelling adults in 46 LMICs, and explore the mediators of these relationships.
World Health Survey data included 228,024 adults aged ≥18 years from 46 LMICs. PA was assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Nine chronic physical conditions (chronic back pain, angina, arthritis, asthma, diabetes, hearing problems, tuberculosis, visual impairment and edentulism) were assessed. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analyses were used to assess the association between chronic conditions or multimorbidity and low PA.
Overall, in the multivariable analysis, arthritis (OR = 1.12), asthma (1.19), diabetes (OR = 1.33), edentulism (OR = 1.46), hearing problems (OR = 1.90), tuberculosis (OR = 1.24), visual impairment (OR = 2.29), multimorbidity (OR = 1.31; 95% CI = 1.21-1.42) were significantly associated with low PA. More significant associations were observed in individuals aged ≥50 years. In older adults, depression mediated between 5.1% (visual impairment) to 23.5% (angina) of the association between a chronic condition and low PA. Mobility difficulties explained more than 25% of the association for seven of the eight chronic conditions. Pain was a strong mediator for angina (65.9%) and arthritis (64.9%), while sleep problems mediated up to 43.7% (angina) of the association.
In LMICs, those with chronic conditions and multimorbidity are significantly less physically active (especially older adults). Research on the efficacy and effectiveness of PA in the management of chronic diseases in LMICs is urgently needed. Targeted promotion of physical activity to populations in LMICs experiencing chronic conditions may ameliorate associated depression, mobility difficulties and pain that are themselves important barriers for initiating or adopting an active lifestyle.",0
"In people with psychosis, physical comorbidities, including cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, are highly prevalent and leading contributors to the premature mortality encountered. However, little is known about physical health multimorbidity in this population or in people with subclinical psychosis and in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study explores physical health multimorbidity patterns among people with psychosis or subclinical psychosis.
Overall, data from 242,952 individuals from 48 LMICs, recruited via the World Health Survey, were included in this cross-sectional study. Participants were subdivided into those (1) with a lifetime diagnosis of psychosis (""psychosis""); (2) with more than one psychotic symptom in the past 12 months, but no lifetime diagnosis of psychosis (""subclinical psychosis""); and (3) without psychotic symptoms in the past 12 months or a lifetime diagnosis of psychosis (""controls""). Nine operationalized somatic disorders were examined: arthritis, angina pectoris, asthma, diabetes, chronic back pain, visual impairment, hearing problems, edentulism, and tuberculosis. The association between psychosis and multimorbidity was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analysis.
The prevalence of multimorbidity (i.e., two or more physical health conditions) was: controls = 11.4% (95% CI, 11.0-11.8%); subclinical psychosis = 21.8% (95% CI, 20.6-23.0%), and psychosis = 36.0% (95% CI, 32.1-40.2%) (P < 0.0001). After adjustment for age, sex, education, country-wise wealth, and country, subclinical psychosis and psychosis were associated with 2.20 (95% CI, 2.02-2.39) and 4.05 (95% CI, 3.25-5.04) times higher odds for multimorbidity. Moreover, multimorbidity was increased in subclinical and established psychosis in all age ranges (18-44, 45-64, ≥ 65 years). However, multimorbidity was most evident in younger age groups, with people aged 18-44 years with psychosis at greatest odds of physical health multimorbidity (OR = 4.68; 95% CI, 3.46-6.32).
This large multinational study demonstrates that physical health multimorbidity is increased across the psychosis-spectrum. Most notably, the association between multimorbidity and psychosis was stronger among younger adults, thus adding further impetus to the calls for the early intervention efforts to prevent the burden of physical health comorbidity at later stages. Urgent public health interventions are necessary not only for those with a psychosis diagnosis, but also for subclinical psychosis to address this considerable public health problem.",0
"The aim of this study was to assess the incidence rate for surgical site infections (SSI), patient- and therapy-related risk factors in UICC stage III and IV oral squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with preoperative radiochemotherapy, ablative surgery and immediate microvascular free flap reconstruction.
This retrospective analysis included 85 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma treated by neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy, tumor surgery and immediate free flap reconstruction. Patient-, therapy-related factors and blood parameters were collected for this selective cohort.
The incidence for SSI was 44.7% and for transplant loss 14.1%. Minor BMI changes (p = 0.010), diabetes (p = 0.003), edentulous status (p = 0.006) and cessation of alcohol consumption (0.034) showed to be significant patient-related risk factors. No therapy-related factors were found to be significantly influencing the risk for SSI. Neutrophil counts (p = 0.027) and GGT (p = 0.002) were found to be significantly linked to SSI.
The not so common treatment option for oral squamous cell carcinomas showed no more risk for SSI compared to standard treatment options. Preserving the ability for healthy nutrition has a significant impact on the development of SSI. This applies not only to the presented and particular treatment option.",0
"The co-existence of depression and psychotic experiences (PEs) is associated with more pronounced adverse health outcomes compared to depression alone. However, data on its prevalence and correlates are lacking in the general adult population, and there is no published data on its association with chronic physical conditions.
Cross-sectional, community-based data from 201 337 adults aged ⩾18 years from 47 low- and middle-income countries from the World Health Survey were analyzed. The presence of past 12-month PE and DSM-IV depression was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Information on six chronic medical conditions (chronic back pain, edentulism, arthritis, angina, asthma, diabetes) were obtained by self-report. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed.
The crude overall prevalence of co-morbid depression/PEs was 2.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-2.7%], with the age- and sex-adjusted prevalence ranging from 0.1% (Sri Lanka, Vietnam) to 9.03% (Brazil). Younger age, urban setting, current smoking, alcohol consumption, and anxiety were significant correlates of co-existing depression/PEs. Co-occurring depression/PEs was associated with significantly higher odds for arthritis, angina, and diabetes beyond that of depression alone after adjusting for sociodemographics, anxiety, and country, with odds ratios (depression/PEs v. depression only) being: arthritis 1.30 (95% CI 1.07-1.59, p = 0.0086); angina 1.40 (95% CI 1.18-1.67, p = 0.0002); diabetes 1.65 (95% CI 1.21-2.26, p = 0.0017).
The prevalence of co-existing depression/PEs was non-negligible in most countries. Our study suggests that when depression/PE or a chronic condition (e.g. arthritis, angina, diabetes) is detected, screening for the other may be important to improve clinical outcomes.",0
"The aim of this study was to investigate the association between oral health status and central obesity (CO) in Brazilian independent-living elderly. A cross-sectional study was carried out in a sample of 489 elderly, who were participants of the Study on Aging and Longevity, in Londrina, state of Parana. The number of natural teeth and use of prostheses were evaluated according to the World Health Organization criteria. The presence of CO was assessed using measures of waist circumference (WC) and waist-hip ratio (WHR). Information concerning sociodemographic profile and some systemic conditions was also collected. Data were analyzed using stepwise logistic regression, α=5%. According to WC and WHR measures, the prevalence of central obesity was 79.3% and 76.1%, respectively. CO according to WC was not associated with oral status. Considering the WHR measure, the following oral conditions were associated to CO: having fewer natural teeth (OR = 2.61; 95%CI = 1.17-5.80), being edentulous and wearing both upper and lower complete dentures (OR = 2.34; 95%CI = 1.11-4.93), and being edentulous wearing only the upper complete denture (OR = 2.64; 95%CI = 1.01-6.95). Traditional risk factors for CO such as gender, dyslipidemia, hypertension and diabetes were associated with both measures. A poor oral health due to extensive tooth loss, whether partial or complete, even if rehabilitated by removable prostheses, may be considered a good predictor of CO in Brazilian independent-living elderly.",0
"DesignCohort studyCohort selectionParticipants were recruited between 1994 and 1998 from the general population with the preferred ages of 35 to 65 years in women and 40 to 65 years in men.Exposure measurementSmoking was assessed using a questionnaire from which pack years of smoking were calculated. Educational attainment, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, alcohol consumption and vitamin or mineral supplements were assessed from measurements and questionnaires. Tooth loss was also assessed by questionnaire returned between 2004 and 2006. With the exception of the tooth loss data analysis was based on data collected at baseline.Data analysisThe 24,373 participants who returned the tooth loss questionnaire were analysed. Two hundred and eighty-six (1.2%) were excluded, as they did not respond to either of the tooth loss questions, and an additional 106 (0.4%) were excluded because they gave inconsistent responses to the questions on tooth loss. Four hundred and thirteen (1.7%) participants with missing data on cigarette smoking and 192 (0.8%) participants with missing data in any of the covariates were also excluded. The association between smoking and number of teeth at baseline was assessed using negative binomial regression models to obtain relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).ResultsThe sample of 23,376 included 9,032 men and 14,344 women of which 4,394 (19%) were current cigarette smokers, and 7,268 (31%) were cigarette smokers. 1,566 (6.7%) were edentulous at baseline. Compared with never smokers, current smokers were more likely to be male, less educated, more likely to be hypertensive, and less likely to take vitamins/mineral supplements, and they had higher alcohol consumption. Cigarette smoking was associated with higher prevalence of tooth loss at baseline as well as higher incidence of tooth loss during follow-up. The association between cigarette smoking and incident tooth loss during follow-up for the fully adjusted model (adjusted for age, sex, education, diabetes, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, hormone replacement therapy, contraception, intake of vitamin and mineral supplements, physical activity, alcohol intake, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease) is shown in the table.ConclusionsThere is a strong dose-dependent association between cigarette smoking and the risk of tooth loss. The risk declines after cessation of cigarette smoking; however, the risk may remain elevated for up to 20 years compared with never smokers. Efforts to improve the oral health of the population should include the prevention of smoking as well the promotion of smoking cessation.",0
"Continuous bone resorption is the primary reason for complete denture relines. Because resorption rates vary, the frequency at which individuals require relines also varies. Currently, there are no predictors to identify individuals at risk of frequent relines or to guide clinicians in decisions related to relines.
The purpose of this cross-sectional pilot study was to determine the utility of measuring bone metabolic markers (C-terminal telopeptide, osteocalcin, 25-OH hydroxy vitamin D) to predict the frequency of complete denture relines.
One hundred adult participants with complete dentures (either maxillary, mandibular, or both) participated in 1 dental clinic visit involving a dental examination and brief interview to obtain relevant medical and dental history, information on medication/supplement use, and 1 laboratory blood draw for the measurement of bone metabolic markers. Data were analyzed by using the Pearson correlation, independent Student t test, or analysis of variance (α=.05).
Significant correlations were found between the frequency of relines and C-telopeptide and osteocalcin levels but not with vitamin D or age. No significant associations with reline frequency and other factors (sex, ethnicity, presence or absence of diabetes, use of calcium and vitamin D supplements) were observed.
Elevated levels of bone turnover markers in individuals with edentulism were associated with increased frequency of denture relines.",0
"Obesity as a systemic risk factor associated with implant failure or other complications has not been studied. The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of implant failure and complications between obese and nonobese patients.
Charts from 220 partially edentulous patients with 321 implants were examined for demographic information, medical health history, diabetes, smoking, patient-reported height and weight, periodontal status (no, mild, moderate, or severe periodontitis), tooth number, date of the implant and prosthesis placement, and treatment notes pertinent to the complications or failure. Subjects were classified according to their body mass index (BMI) as normal (18.5 to 24.5 kg/m(2)), overweight (25 to 29.9 kg/m(2)), or obese (≥ 30 kg/m(2)) based on self-reported height and weight. Variables including sex, smoking, diabetes, and periodontal condition were considered as confounders. Data were analyzed to examine differences in frequency of complications and occurrence of failures.
Implant failure was low (2.1%) and did not differ by BMI category. Compared with normal BMI patients, obese patients had increased odds of experiencing an implant complication (OR = 4.9, 95% CI [1.4, 17.6]) after adjustment for other variables. Diabetes was not associated with an increased risk of complications; obese patients with diabetes had decreased odds of an implant complication compared with obese patients without diabetes.
No association was observed between obesity and implant failures. BMI category was associated with implant complications; obese patients have greater odds of experiencing implant complications postsurgically. Treating obese patients with the existing protocol for diabetic patients (antibiotic regimens, more frequent follow-up, and maintenance appointments) may improve clinical outcomes.",0
"Studies in high-income countries have reported associations between tooth loss and hypertension. There is however a lack of evidence on this association from South Asian countries especially India. The current study aimed to assess the association between self-reported tooth loss and hypertension in a primarily rural middle-aged and older Indian population.
A secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from the Longitudinal Ageing Study of India - pilot survey was conducted on 1,486 adults aged 45 years and above from four states of India. The primary outcome was self-reported hypertension and the main explanatory variable was self-reported tooth loss. Multivariable logistic regression models estimated the association between hypertension and tooth loss after controlling for confounders including age, sex, marital status, area of residence, educational attainment, tobacco use, alcohol use, physical activity, and self-reported diabetes.
Compared to those without any tooth loss, individuals with partial tooth loss had 1.62 times (95% CI: 1.12-2.35) higher odds of being hypertensive after adjustment of confounders including age, sex, marital status, area of residence, educational attainment, tobacco use, alcohol use, physical activity, and self-reported diabetes. The crude significant association (OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.50-4.29) between edentulousness and hypertension became nonsignificant and attenuated after adjustment of potential confounders (fully adjusted model OR: 1.33; 95% CI: 0.72-2.44).
Partial tooth loss was associated with a higher probability of hypertension among dentate middle-aged and older adults in four states of India.",0
"Good and well balanced diet provided by adequate mastication is part of therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The critical period presents the time immediately after teeth extractions; hence, immediate denture is a rational therapeutical choice for diabetic patients. The presence of immediate denture and its compression might compromise wound healing process, affect chewing ability, food intake and consequently blood glucose level in type 2 DM patients.
The objective of this study was to compare socket opening diameters (SOD), chewing ability, changes in blood glucose level and food intake in type 2 DM patients with and without maxillary immediate complete denture (MICD) during a three-week wound healing period.
The study comprised 78 type 2 DM partially removable denture wearers (42 candidates for teeth extractions and 36 candidates for teeth extractions and insertion of MICDs). During the three-week period participants were followed for SOD, chewing ability and changes in blood glucose level and food intake.
Patients with MICD showed significantly lower reduction of SOD (seventh, 14th, 21st day) and higher chewing ability (seventh, 14th, 21st day) in comparison to patients without an MICD. Significantly lower number of patients with an MICD had changes in blood glucose level and food intake.
Maxillary immediate complete denture presents a good therapeutic choice for type 2 DM patients, as it provides possibility of adequate mastication after teeth extractions and maintenance of nutritional status and blood glucose level.",0
"The older adult population is growing rapidly in the USA and it is expected that by 2040 the number of adults ≥ 65 years of age will have increased by about 50%. With the growth of this subpopulation, oral health status, and periodontal status in particular, becomes important in the quest to maintain an adequate quality of life. Poor oral health can have a major impact, leading to tooth loss, pain and discomfort, and may prevent older adults from chewing food properly, often leading to poor nutrition. Periodontitis is monitored in the USA at the national level as part of the Healthy People 2020 initiative. In this report, we provide estimates of the overall burden of periodontitis among adults ≥ 65 years of age and after stratification according to sociodemographic factors, modifiable risk factors (such as smoking status), the presence of other systemic conditions (such as diabetes) and access to dental care. We also estimated the burden of periodontitis within this age group at the state and local levels. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009/2010 and 2011/2012 cycles were analyzed. Periodontal measures from both survey cycles were based on a full-mouth periodontal examination. Nineteen per cent of adults in this subpopulation were edentulous. The mean age was 73 years, 7% were current smokers, 8% lived below the 100% Federal Poverty Level and < 40% had seen a dentist in the past year. Almost two-thirds (62.3%) had one or more sites with ≥ 5 mm of clinical attachment loss and almost half had at least one site with probing pocket depth of ≥ 4 mm. We estimated the lowest prevalence of periodontitis in Utah (62.3%) and New Hampshire (62.6%) and the highest in New Mexico, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia each with a prevalence of higher than 70%. Overall, periodontitis is highly prevalent in this subpopulation, with two-thirds of dentate older adults affected at any geographic level. These findings provide an opportunity to determine how the overall health-care management of older adults should consider the improvement of their oral health conditions. Many older adults do not have dental insurance and are also likely to have some chronic conditions, which can adversely affect their oral health.",0
"The world's population is aging, and it has been estimated that by 2050, the number of people 65 years of age and older will reach 1.5 billion. The aging population will be affected by noncommunicable chronic diseases, including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and cognitive impairment. This important demographic shift includes a reduction in tooth loss/edentulism, particularly in older adults of the developed countries in North America, western Europe and north-east Asia. Therefore, in the future, dental providers will be required to care for an expanded number of older adults who have retained teeth and are medically complex. As the linkage of oral disease and systemic disease has focused on the relationship of periodontitis and noncommunicable chronic diseases, a broad review of 'geriatric periodontology' is both timely and important. This volume of Periodontology 2000 covers a range of subjects under this heading. Included are the demographics of an aging world; the effect of aging on stem cell function in the periodontium; the periodontal microbiota associated with aging; the host response in the periodontium of aging individuals; an analysis of the prevalence of periodontitis in the USA on a national, state-wide and community basis; differentiation of physiologic oral aging from disease; treatment of periodontal disease in older adults; implant therapy for older patients; oral disease and the frailty syndrome; the relationship of tooth loss to longevity and life expectancy; and the relationship of periodontal disease to noncommunicable chronic diseases. Although 'geriatric dentistry' is not a recognized specialty in dentistry, and 'geriatric periodontology' is a descriptive title, the subject of this volume of Periodontology 2000 is critical to the future of clinical dentistry, dental public health and dental research. Any comprehensive focus on older patients can only be accomplished with an emphasis on interprofessional education and practice. If embraced, this shift will allow the dental profession to be more closely aligned with the larger health-care environment, and can improve both oral health and health outcomes for patients seen in the dental office.",0
"The purpose of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate the survival rate (SVR - i.e. fixtures still in place at the end of the observation period) and success rate (SCR - i.e. bone resorption around implant neck) of two cylindrical implant systems. Both systems were equipped with a tapered connection, one requiring a bone-level (BL) placement, while the other a soft-tissue-level (STL) placement. In the period between January 1996 and October 2011, a total of 150 implants (76 in females and 74 in males, mean age 60±11 years) were inserted. The mean post-surgical follow-up was 84±47 months. Several parameters were evaluated as potential outcome conditioners: age, gender, diabetes, smoking, periodontitis, type of edentulism, replaced tooth, jaw location (i.e. maxilla or mandible), bone graft, immediate loading, post-extractive, type of prosthesis, implant diameter and length. An SPSS program was used for statistical analysis. Only two fixtures were lost, therefore SVR was 98.7%. SCR, expressed through the mean marginal bone loss, was 92%. The mean peri-implant bone loss was 0.121.47 mm for BL implants and 0.041.3 mm for STL implants. None of the studied variables had a statistical significant impact on SVR or SCR. Cylindrical implants are reliable for oral rehabilitation.",0
"The platform switching concept was recently introduced to implant dentistry involving the reduction of restoration abutment diameter with respect to the diameter of dental implant. Long-term follow-up around these implants showed higher levels of bone preservation and proper stress distribution and improved esthetics.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the changes in bone height by means of radiographic examination around platform switched implant supporting mandibular overdentures in controlled diabetic patients.
Fourteen male complete edentulous patients were selected and enrolled in a follow-up study plan. Split mouth technique was applied; one side implant chosen randomly with Platelet-rich-plasma (PRP) and the other without PRP, bone height changes was assessed by Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) radiographic examination after 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year later.
There was increase in bone height loss in both sides but with no statistical significance difference between the two sides after 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year respectively.
The result of this article satisfied the patients both esthetically and functionally with recorded increase in bone height loss.",0
"To investigate the association between diabetes mellitus and missing teeth in Hispanic/Latino adults from diverse heritage groups who reside in the USA.
The Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) is a multicenter, population-based study of 18-74 years old who underwent a physical and oral examination (n=15 945). Glycemic status was categorized as diabetes, impaired, or normal, based on medication use, and American Diabetes Association criteria for fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). HbA1c<7% indicated good glycemic control, and HbA1c>7% indicated uncontrolled diabetes. We estimated ORs and 95% CIs for missing >9 teeth and being edentulous (missing all natural teeth), after adjustment for age, income, education, Hispanic background, study site/center, nativity, last dental visit, health insurance, diet quality, cigarette smoking, obesity, periodontitis, and C reactive protein.
Persons with uncontrolled diabetes had a significant increased likelihood of missing >9 teeth and being edentulous as compared with persons with normal glycemic status (adjusted OR=1.92, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.55 and adjusted OR=1.73, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.46, respectively). The association appeared to be stronger at younger ages (18-44 years old; p for interaction <0.0001). However, we found no associations of either impaired glycemia or controlled diabetes with tooth loss in adjusted models.
Dentists should be aware of their Hispanic patients' diabetes status and whether or not they are well controlled, because these may affect tooth loss and impair oral function, which can lead to poor nutrition and complications of diabetes.",0
"The relationship between type 2 diabetes oral physiology, nutritional intake and quality of life has not been fully elucidated. We assessed the impact of type 2 diabetes - exclusive or associated with hypertension with beta-blockers treatment - on oral physiology, mastication, nutrition and quality of life. This cross-sectional study was performed with 78 complete dentate subjects (15 natural teeth and six masticatory units minimum; without removable or fixed prostheses), divided into three groups: diabetics (DM) (n = 20; 45·4 ± 9·5 years), diabetics with hypertension and receiving beta-blockers treatment (DMH) (n = 19; 41·1 ± 5·1 years) and controls (n = 39; 44·5 ± 11·7 years) matched for gender, age and socioeconomic status. Blood glucose, masticatory performance, swallowing threshold, taste, food intake, stimulated and unstimulated salivary flow, pH and buffering capacity of saliva were assessed. Glycemia was higher in DM than in controls (P < 0·01). No differences were observed between DM and controls for nutrition and quality of life. Both stimulated and unstimulated salivary flow rate were lower in DMH (P < 0·01), which also presented the lowest number of teeth and masticatory units (P < 0·0001), and reduction in the number of chewing cycles (P < 0·01). Controls showed lower Decayed Missing Filled Teeth index (DMFT) scores in comparison with DMH (P = 0·021). Masticatory performance and saliva buffering capacity were similar among groups. Exclusive type 2 diabetes did not alter oral physiology, nutrition or quality of life. However, when hypertension and beta-blockers treatment were associated with diabetes, the salivary flow rate, chewing cycles and number of teeth decreased.",0
"Oral disease is a potentially treatable determinant of mortality and quality of life. No comprehensive multinational study to quantify oral disease burden and to identify candidate preventative strategies has been performed in the dialysis setting.
The ORAL disease in hemoDialysis (ORALD) study was a prospective study in adults treated with hemodialysis in Europe (France, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Spain) and Argentina. Oral disease was assessed using standardized WHO methods. Participants self-reported oral health practices and symptoms. Sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with oral diseases were determined and assessed within nation states.
Of 4726 eligible adults, 4205 (88.9%) participated. Overall, 20.6% were edentulous [95% confidence interval (CI), 19.4-21.8]. Participants had on average 22 (95% CI 21.7-22.2) decayed, missing or filled teeth, while moderate to severe periodontitis affected 40.6% (95% CI 38.9-42.3). Oral disease patterns varied markedly across countries, independent of participant demographics, comorbidity and health practices. Participants in Spain, Poland, Italy and Hungary had the highest mean adjusted odds of edentulousness (2.31, 1.90, 1.90 and 1.54, respectively), while those in Poland, Hungary, Spain and Argentina had the highest odds of ≥14 decayed, missing or filled teeth (23.2, 12.5, 8.14 and 5.23, respectively). Compared with Argentina, adjusted odds ratios for periodontitis were 58.8, 58.3, 27.7, 12.1 and 6.30 for Portugal, Italy, Hungary, France and Poland, respectively. National levels of tobacco consumption, diabetes and child poverty were associated with edentulousness within countries.
Oral disease in adults on hemodialysis is very common, frequently severe and highly variable among countries, with much of the variability unexplained by participant characteristics or healthcare. Given the national variation and high burden of disease, strategies to improve oral health in hemodialysis patients will require implementation at a country level rather than at the level of individuals.",0
"The aim of this study was to identify systemic and local risk indicators associated with peri-implantitis.
One hundred eighty-three patients treated with 916 osseointegrated titanium implants, in function for at least 1 year, were included in the present study. The implants were installed at the Foundation for Scientific and Technological Development of Dentistry (FUNDECTO) - University of Sao Paulo (USP) - from 1998 to 2012. Factors related to patient's systemic conditions (heart disorders, hypertension, smoking habits, alcoholism, liver disorders, hepatitis, gastrointestinal disease, diabetes mellitus I and II, hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, menopause, osteoporosis, active periodontal disease, history of periodontal disease and bruxism), implant's characteristics (location, diameter, length, connection, shape, and antagonist), and clinical parameters (wear facets, periodontal status on the adjacent tooth, plaque accumulation on the adjacent tooth, modified plaque index, sulcus bleeding index, probing depth, bleeding on probing, width of keratinized tissue and marginal recession).
An increased risk of 2.2 times for history of periodontal disease (PD), 3.6 times for cemented restorations compared to screw-retained prostheses, 2.4 times when wear facets were displayed on the prosthetic crown and 16.1 times for total rehabilitations when compared to single rehabilitations were found. Logistic regression analysis did not show any association between the implant's characteristics and peri-implantitis.
A history of periodontal disease, cemented prostheses, presences of wear facets on the prosthetic crown and full mouth rehabilitations were identified as risk indicators for peri-implantitis. Implants' characteristics were not related to the presence of peri-implantitis.",0
"This study presents the global burden of major oral diseases with an exegetical commentary on their current profiles, the critical issues in oral healthcare and future perspectives.
A narrative overview of current literature was undertaken to synthesise the contexts with critical elaboration and commentary.
Oral disease is one of the most common public health issues worldwide with significant socio-economic impacts, and yet it is frequently neglected in public health policy. The oral data extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study in 2010 (Murray et al, 2012) show that caries, periodontal disease, edentulism, oral cancer and cleft lip/palate collectively accounted for 18 814 000 disability-adjusted life-years; and the global burden of periodontal disease, oral cancer and caries increased markedly by an average of 45.6% from 1990 to 2010 in parallel with the major non-communicable diseases like diabetes by 69.0%. Oral diseases and non-communicable diseases are closely interlinked through sharing common risk factors (e.g. excess sugar consumption and tobacco use) and underlying infection/inflammatory pathways.
Oral disease remains a major public health burden worldwide. It is of great importance to integrate oral health into global health agenda via the common risk factor approach. The long-term sustainable strategy for global oral health should focus on health promotion and disease prevention through effective multidisciplinary teamwork.",0
"The purpose of this review is to estimate the prevalence of peri-implantitis, as well as to determine possible risk factors associated with its development in patients treated with oral implants.
Although implant therapy has been identified as a successful and predictable treatment for partially and fully edentulous patients, complications and failures can occur. Peri-implantitis is considered a biologic complication that results in bone loss around implants and may lead to implant treatment failure.
A great variation has been observed in the literature regarding the prevalence of peri-implantitis according to the diagnostic criteria used to define peri-implantitis. The prevalence ranges from 4.7 to 43% at implant level, and from 8.9 to > 56% at patient level. Many risk factors that may lead to the establishment and progression of peri-implantitis have been suggested. There is strong evidence that presence and history of periodontitis are potential risk factors for peri-implantitis. Cigarette smoking has not yet been conclusively established as a risk factor for peri-implantitis, although extra care should be taken with dental implant in smokers. Other risk factors, such as diabetes, genetic traits, implant surface roughness and presence of keratinized mucosa still require further investigation.
Peri-implantitis is not an uncommon complication following implant therapy. A higher prevalence of peri-implantitis has been identified for patients with presence or history of periodontal disease and for smokers. Until now, a true risk factor for peri-implantitis has not been established. Supportive maintenance program is essential for the long-term success of treatments with oral implants.
The knowledge of the real impact of peri-implantitis on the outcome of treatments with oral implants as well as the identification of risk factors associated to this inflammatory condition are essential for the development of supportive maintenance programs and the establishment of prevention protocols.",0
"This study evaluated the prevalence and severity of tooth loss in Uruguayan elders, assessing its association with demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors; the use of health services; and self-reported dental treatment need.
A population-based cross-sectional study was done among Uruguayan individuals of ages 65-74 years. Data were collected through questionnaires and clinical examinations. The dependent variable, tooth loss, was classified into three distinct outcomes: functional dentition (≥20 teeth), severe tooth loss (<9 teeth), and edentulism. The independent variables were: sex, socioeconomic status, use of health services, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, frequent consumption of alcohol, hygiene habits, and need for dental care.
The sample comprised 341 individuals, and the mean number of teeth present was 9.73 (95% confidence interval, 8.77-10.69) for each individual. After multivariate analysis, lack of a functional dentition, severe tooth loss, and edentulism were found to be associated with lower socioeconomic level, frequent consumption of alcohol, and receiving treatment from the public health system (P < 0.05). Individuals with self-reported dental treatment need had more severe tooth loss and presented a higher degree of edentulism (P < 0.05).
There is a high and severe prevalence of tooth loss in elderly Uruguayans, especially among those from lower socioeconomic levels. Our findings highlight the importance of public health policies to prevent and treat tooth loss.",0
"Decompensated diabetes is a major risk factor in the development of periodontal diseases. This leads to disturbances of carbohydrates, protein, and fat and morphological changes in many organs. These changes also apply to the masticatory system, especially periodontal tissues. The aim of the study was to assess the periodontal status and periodontal treatment needs in patients with non-controlled diabetes type 1 and type 2 (HbA1c > 7%), and to compare the results with the data obtained in a group of generally healthy patients.
The study included 275 patients, 155 of them were patients with non-controlled diabetes during hospitalisation (study group), while 120 subjects constituted the control group of healthy people. The study excluded edentulous people. CPITN index (according to Ainamo et al.) was used to assess the periodontal state and periodontal treatment needs.
The average level of glycated haemoglobin HbA1C among patients in the study group was 9.43% in women and slightly more at 9.57% in men. The periodontal status in healthy people was satisfactory, dominated by the maximum values of CPITN = 0, CPITN = 1, and CPITN = 2. The study group more frequently revealed the maximum values of CPITN = 3 and CPITN = 4. This shows the more advanced periodontal changes in this group. Due to the bad condition of the periodontium, the periodontal treatment needs proved to be far greater in the study group and related primarily to comprehensive specialist treatment (TN3).
Decompensated diabetes may be an important cause of changes in periodontal tissues and may cause a significant loss of masticatory function in patients.",0
"Peri-implant marginal bone-level (MBL) alteration represents one of the parameters included in the criteria for determining implant health.
Factors affecting peri-implant MBL alteration for 4-implant-supported fixed mandibular prostheses (4-ISFMP) were assessed.
A 3-year prospective, cohort study was conducted on 44 mandibularly edentulous patients treated with 4-ISFMP. Peri-implant MBL alteration was evaluated radiographically at the 12-, 24- and 36-month follow-ups considering to patient-related risk factors [age, gender, diabetes mellitus, smoking, cardiovascular disease (CVD), rheumatic disorders (RD)] and implant/prosthesis-related features (implant location, keratinized gingiva, denture cantilever length, prosthesis supporting zone, opposing dentition) as well as to peri-implant biological parameters (plaque-, bleeding-, calculus index).
148/176 implants (37 patients, drop-out: 15%) were followed for 3 years showing significant (p < 0.001) annual differences of MBL alterations over time. The univariate analysis demonstrated differences of MBL alterations for smokers (p = 0.014), for patients with CVD (p = 0.001) and RD (p = 0.011). In the 3-year multivariate analysis, MBL alteration was influenced by time (p < 0.001) and showed relationship with risk factors as smoking (p < 0.002; OR = 18.965), CVD (p < 0.021; OR = 5.172), RD (p < 0.006; OR = 50.171) and plaque-index (p = 0.034; OR = 3.252).
Although peri-implant MBL alteration increased annually, significant odds ratios, were found for patients-related risk factors identifying them potentiating the alterations.",0
"To examine the existing evidence in identifying risk indicators in the etiology of peri-implantitis.
A literature search was performed in MEDLINE via PubMed database of the US National Library of Medicine, for articles published until October 2014 using Medical Subject Heading search terms + free text terms and in different combinations.
The microbiota associated with peri-implantitis is complex, demonstrating differences and similarities to the one seen at periodontitis sites. Plaque accumulation at dental implants triggers the inflammatory response leading to peri-implant mucositis/peri-implantitis. Individuals with a history of periodontal disease and smokers have an increased risk of developing peri-implantitis. There is some evidence to support the role of genetic polymorphism, diabetes, and excess cement as risk indicators for the development of peri-implantitis. There is also evidence to support that individuals on regular maintenance are less likely to develop peri-implantitis and that successful treatment of periodontitis prior to implant placement lowers the risk of peri-implantitis.
Plaque accumulation at implants will result in the development of an inflammation at implants. A history of periodontal disease, smoking, excess cement, and lack of supportive therapy should be considered as risk indicators for the development of peri-implantitis.",0
"To investigate the relationship of dental status to food diversity among older Japanese.
A community-based cross-sectional study conducted in the town of Tosa, Kochi Prefecture, Japan.
The study participants were 252 Japanese (84 men and 168 women, average age 81.2 years) and dentate participants were classified into three groups: 1-9 teeth, 10-19 teeth and 20 or more teeth. Food diversity was assessed as a validated measure of dietary quality using the 11-item Food Diversity Score Kyoto (FDSK-11), which evaluates frequency of consumption of 11 main food groups. Multivariable analysis of the differences in FDSK-11 score ranging from 0 to 11, with a higher score indicating greater food diversity, among the three dental status groups was conducted using general linear models. All the performed analyses were stratified by gender.
There was no association between dental status and food diversity score in models for men. In contrast, women with ≤ 9 teeth and with 10-19 teeth had significantly lower FDSK-11 scores than women with ≥ 20 teeth after adjusting for confounders (p < 0.001 and p = 0.009, respectively). Additionally, there was a trend toward lower scores for FDSK-11 with fewer teeth (p = 0.001).
A less varied diet, as indicated by low FDSK-11 score, was observed in female participants with fewer teeth. Tooth loss was associated with poor diet quality among older Japanese women.",0
"Diabetes care includes annual evaluation of micro- and macrovascular complications, however, oral pathologies are not included. We studied retrieving oral health information, in particular periodontal disease, from the dentist and studied the association between the reported periodontal condition and variables of both diabetes and dental care.
During their annual comprehensive diabetes evaluation, patients were asked to deliver an oral health questionnaire (OHQ) to their dentist. Based on the returned OHQs, the process of retrieving oral health information from the dentist was analyzed. In addition, reported oral health measures with special emphasis to periodontitis, using a Periodontal Screening Index (PSI), were related to diabetes-related variables.
We included 889 patients of whom 102 patients (11%) did not visit a dentist at all and 252 (28%) were edentulous. The response rate was <50% for oral information on patients with diabetes. For the second aim, OHQs of 207 patients could be further analyzed. A moderate to high PSI-score was found in 106 patients, of whom 65% were untreated for periodontitis. Furthermore high PSI-scores were associated with poor oral hygiene, soft tissue pathologies and periodontal treatment, but not significantly with glycemic control and presence of diabetes complications.
The transfer of information from the dentist to the diabetologist is far from optimal. An OHQ can be a valuable tool for the identification of patients with diabetes with poor oral health especially untreated periodontal disease, which is helpful for proper diabetes management.",0
"Information currently available regarding the oral health of elderly people is poor, especially in Italy. The aim of this study was to evaluate oral health conditions in older people in the city of Ancona, Italy. The usefulness of a dedicated medical record, specifically designed for older people, was tested.
A total of 124 elderly subjects aged between 65 and 95 years, all autonomous and self-sufficient, were recruited for this study. The specific medical/dental record, designed for older people, was used to collect data and was divided into three parts. The first part lists the patient's demographics. The second part was devoted to general medical history. The third part includes the dental history and the dental visit. As regards the oral conditions, injury to the soft tissues, degree of oral hygiene, presence of caries, periodontal diseases, missing teeth, presence of the prosthesis, and presence of xerostomia, were noticed.
Among the examined subjects 53% were male and 47% were female. The most prevalent medical condition was hypertension (64.5%); 74.2% of the examined population took up to 3 drugs/day, while the 25.8% more than 3 drugs/day. Only 9.6% of patients had soft tissues lesions and only 33.3% had sufficient oral hygiene; 45.1% of patients suffered decayed teeth; 44% of patients had fewer than 8 missing teeth, the 33.4% had the number of missing teeth including between 9 and 15, and 22.6% had more than 16 missing teeth. Only 7 patients were completely edentulous; 32.3% of the patients had fixed partial dentures, 17.7% had removable partial dentures, 22.6% had both fixed partial dentures and removable partial dentures, 4% removable total dentures and 23.4% do not have any dentures. Only 29.1% patients had xerostomia.
The most important data from this study are the following: 1) the majority of elderly patients is hypertensive; 2) the majority of elderly patients take up to 3 drugs/day; 3) the majority of elderly patients has insufficient oral hygiene; 4) the majority of elderly patients do not have removable dentures but fixed dentures. Therefore, it is important to preserve and take care of the teeth of the older people, especially of the autonomous and self-sufficient elderly patients. Further visits are therefore necessary in order to make a complete epidemiological study in Ancona.",0
"Evidence suggests that taller individuals have better health than that of shorter individuals. However, evidence for links to tooth loss is scarce. The aim of this study was to examine the association between adult height and tooth loss and to examine the roles of covariates in explaining the association in different birth cohorts in Korea.
Using data from the Fourth and Fifth Korea National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (KNHANES IV and V), the subjects were grouped into two birth cohorts based on their historical context: born from 1920 to 1945 and 1946 to 1962. The dependent variables were loss of 8 or more teeth and total tooth loss (edentulism), while the independent variable was the height quartile. Demographic factors (survey year, age, and gender), early childhood/adult socioeconomic status (SES) (father's education, own education, income, and place of residence), health behaviors (cigarette smoking, binge drinking, frequency of toothbrushing, and regular dental visit), and health problems (diabetes and hypertension) were included in a series of analytical models.
The survey year-, age-, and gender-adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) of the loss of 8 or more teeth for the shortest quartile were 1.23 (95% confidence intervals, CI: 1.13-1.35) for the 1920-1945 birth cohorts and 1.39 (95% CI: 1.20-1.62) for the 1946-1962 birth cohorts. The PRs for edentulousness were 1.64 (95% CI: 1.34-2.02) for the 1920-1945 birth cohorts and 2.26 (95% CI: 1.31-3.91) for the 1946-1962 birth cohorts. These associations were moderately attenuated after adjusting for own education but still significant in the fully adjusted models. After full adjustment for the covariates, those in the shortest height quartiles in the relatively young birth cohorts (1946-1962 birth cohorts) had a 1.93 (95% CI: 1.09-3.43) times greater prevalence of edentulism than that of their tallest counterparts.
Given that adult height reflects early-life conditions, independent associations between height and tooth loss support the view that early-life circumstances significantly influence oral health outcomes in later life.",0
"There are few reports showing an association between childhood socioeconomic circumstances and tooth loss among the elderly. The purpose of this study was (i) to examine the association between early childhood socioeconomic position (parental education level) and tooth loss and (ii) to determine the relative effects of the subjects' education level, occupation, and income on tooth loss in Korean elders.
Data from the fourth and fifth Korea National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey on 8814 Korean elders (age ≥65 years) were analyzed. Demographic factors (age, survey year, marital status, and residence area), health behaviors (dental check-up during the past year and cigarette smoking), and the presence of a somatic health problem (diabetes) were included in our gender-specific analyses. Tooth loss was defined as edentulism or severe tooth loss (<20 teeth). For our analyses, chi-square test and Student's t-tests and multiple logistic regressions were performed.
A low parental education level was associated with elevated odds of edentulism (OR = 1.87 for father's education and 1.52 for mother's education among male elders and OR = 1.73 for father's education and 1.55 for mother's education among female elders) and with severe tooth loss (OR = 1.58 for father's education and 1.53 for mother's education among male elders and OR = 1.25 for father's education and 1.48 for mother's education among female elders). The association between parental education level and tooth loss was attenuated after adjusting for the subject's education level, occupation, and income. Relative magnitude of attenuation varied with personal factors (education > income > occupation). In a fully adjusted model, father's education level was significantly associated with edentate status (OR = 1.96 for male elders and 1.46 for female elders), but not with severe tooth loss.
Our results indicate that early life socioeconomic circumstances measured by the father's education level were independently associated with the edentate status of Korean elders.",0
"Periodontitis, the main cause of tooth loss in the middle-aged and elderly, associates with the risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease. The objective was to study the capability of the number of missing teeth in predicting incident cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, and all-cause death. The National FINRISK 1997 Study is a Finnish population-based survey of 8,446 subjects with 13 y of follow-up. Dental status was recorded at baseline in a clinical examination by a trained nurse, and information on incident CVD events, diabetes, and death was obtained via national registers. The registered CVD events included coronary heart disease events, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke. In Cox regression analyses, having ≥5 teeth missing was associated with 60% to 140% increased hazard for incident coronary heart disease events (P < 0.020) and acute myocardial infarction (P < 0.010). Incident CVD (P < 0.043), diabetes (P < 0.040), and death of any cause (P < 0.019) were associated with ≥9 missing teeth. No association with stroke was observed. Adding information on missing teeth to established risk factors improved risk discrimination of death (P = 0.0128) and provided a statistically significant net reclassification improvement for all studied end points. Even a few missing teeth may indicate an increased risk of CVD, diabetes, or all-cause mortality. When individual risk factors for chronic diseases are assessed, the number of missing teeth could be a useful additional indicator for general medical practitioners.",0
"The correlation between insurance status and edentulism has not previously been reported in a population with known access to a dentist, and little is known about patient demographics in corporate dental settings. This study investigated patient demographics of a former dental franchise in Chicopee, Massachusetts, and examined a correlation between dental insurance and edentulism in this group. The correlation of edentulism with age, gender, and dental risk factors (diabetes, temporomandibular disorder, trouble with previous dental work, or oral sores and ulcers) was also examined.
This was a retrospective case study. Age, gender, and presence of dental risk factors were recorded from the patient medical history intake form. Dentate status was recorded from patient odontograms. Dental insurance status was obtained from billing records. Data was aggregated and deidentified. Descriptive and bivariate statistics and logistic regression models were used to identify associations (p-value ≤ 0.05 significance).
Of 1,123 records meeting inclusion criteria, 52.54 percent of patients had dental insurance, 26.27 percent had at least one dental risk factor, and 18.17 percent were edentulous. Age and insurance status were significantly correlated with edentulism. Correcting for age, individuals without insurance were 1.56 times as likely to be edentulous.
This case study provides insight into patient demographics that might seek care in a corporate setting and suggests that access to a dentist alone may not be adequate in preserving the adult dentition; dental insurance may also be important to health. As the corporate dental practice model continues to grow, these topics deserve further study.",0
"To examine associations of pre-diabetes and well-controlled diabetes with periodontitis.
The Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP)-Trend is a cross-sectional survey in North-Eastern Germany including 3086 participants (49.4% men; age 20-82 years). Clinical attachment loss (CAL) and periodontal probing depth (PPD) were assessed applying a random half-mouth protocol. The number of teeth was determined. Pre-diabetes comprised impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance. Previously known diabetes was defined as well controlled if glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was <7.0%. Participants were categorized as follows: normal glucose tolerance (NGT), pre-diabetes, newly detected type 2 diabetes (T2DM), known T2DM with HbA1c<7.0% and known T2DM with HbA1c≥7.0%.
Pre-diabetes was neither associated with mean CAL and PPD in multivariable adjusted linear regression models nor with edentulism (OR = 1.09 (95%-CI: 0.69-1.71)) and number of teeth (OR = 0.96 (95%-CI: 0.75-1.22), lowest quartile versus higher quartiles) in logistic regression models. Associations with mean CAL and edentulism were stronger in poorly controlled previously known diabetes than in well-controlled previously known diabetes (for edentulism: OR = 2.19 (95%-CI: 1.18-4.05), and OR = 1.40 (95%-CI: 0.82-2.38), respectively, for comparison with NGT).
Periodontitis and edentulism were associated with poorly controlled T2DM, but not with pre-diabetes and well-controlled diabetes.",0
"The aim of this study was to evaluate oral health status and oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL) in Iranian patients undergoing hemodialysis.
In this cross-sectional study 145 (95 dentate and 50 edentulous) patients undergoing hemodialysis participated. Demographic information, laboratory findings and dental health status was recorded by a standard form. Oral hygiene status was obtained by simplifed oral hygiene index (OHI-S) and oral health was evaluated by decay missing flling teeth (DMFT) index, plaque index (PLI) and periodontal disease index. Oral health related quality of life was determined by means of short form oral health impact profle (OHIP-14) and general oral health assessment index (GOHAI).
The mean (± SD) DMFT, PLI and PDI were 15.47 ± 7.85, 2.03 ± 0.95, 4.09 ± 1.31 respectively. OHI-S was good in 7 (7.4%), fair 25 (26.6%) and poor in 38 (26.6%) of patients. The mean OHIP-14 and GOHAI scores were 31.32 ± 12.53 and 29.07 ± 8.5 respectively. The self-perceived oral health of 58 (40%) was good, 49(33.8%) was fair and 38 (26.2%) was poor. Patients with higher scores for the questionnaires had significantly worst self-rated oral health. Besides, there was a significant positive correlation between dental and periodontal variables with OHIP-14 and GOHAI scores.
Hemodialysis patients had a poor oral hygiene and periodontal status, weak attitudes and negligence toward oral health but they were satisfed of their oral health condition and their OHRQoL was approximately good. Therefor it should be communications between nephrologists and oral health care professionals for promoting the oral health status of the patients.
The findings high light the need of comprehensive oral examinations including periodontal therapy, restorative treatment, preventive dental treatment and follow-up care in the hemodialysis patients.",0
"The authors conducted a prospective cohort study to determine whether poor glycemic control is a contraindication to implant therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes.
The study sample consisted of 117 edentulous patients, each of whom received two mandibular implants, for a total of 234 implants. Implant-retained mandibular overdentures were loaded after a four-month healing period and followed up for an additional one year. The authors assessed implant survival and stability (by means of resonance frequency analysis) relative to glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, with baseline levels up to 11.1 percent and levels as high as 13.3 percent over one year.
Implant survival rates for 110 of 117 patients who were followed up for one year after loading were 99.0 percent, 98.9 percent and 100 percent, respectively, for patients who did not have diabetes (n = 47), those with well-controlled diabetes (n = 44) and those with poorly controlled diabetes (n = 19). The authors considered the seven patients lost to follow-up as having had failed implants; consequently, their conservative estimates of survival rates in the three groups were 93.0 percent, 92.6 percent and 95.0 percent (P = .6510). Two implants failed at four weeks, one in the nondiabetes group and the other in the well-controlled diabetes group. Delays in implant stabilization were related directly to poor glycemic control.
The results of this study indicate that elevated HbA1c levels in patients with type 2 diabetes were not associated with altered implant survival one year after loading. However, alterations in early bone healing and implant stability were associated with hyperglycemia.",0
"Strokes are common events of significant morbidity and mortality. Poor oral conditions may share or exacerbate pathways that lead to stroke.
This study was a cross-sectional study of 410,939 participants from the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Stroke was defined as the participant's response (yes/no) to the survey's question, ""Has a doctor, nurse or other health professional ever told you that you had a stroke?"" The definition for tooth loss was based upon participant's response to the survey's question, ""How many of your permanent teeth have been removed because of tooth decay or gum disease?"" Descriptive, Chi Square and logistic regression analyses were conducted. Other variables that are known etiologic factors were also included in the analysis.
The participants with increasing numbers of teeth lost had increasing adjusted odds ratios for stroke independent of the other factors. In adjusted logistic regression analysis, the participants who had 1 to 5 missing teeth had an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 1.29 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.17, 1.42), participants who had 6 or more, but not all missing teeth had an AOR of 1.68 (95% CI: 1.50, 1.88), and participants who were edentulous had an AOR of 1.86 (95% CI: 1.63, 2.11).
Evidence from this cross-sectional study indicates that tooth loss had a potential, although weak positive association as an independent factor in multivariable analysis with stroke.",0
"The aim of this exploratory study was to evaluate the effects of hydrogel patch wound dressing on healing time and pain level of denture-related lesions of the oral mucosa in edentulous individuals.
Twenty-three adults with newly fabricated complete sets of dentures who subsequently developed at least two ulcerative lesions related to their complete dentures were included in the study. For each participant, the smaller lesion (control lesion) was allocated to usual care, that is, adjustment of the denture's margins, whereas the larger lesion (test lesion) was assigned to receive usual care plus application of a hydrogel patch. In the latter, a patch was applied directly on the affected area three times within the first 24 hours, followed by application of three additional patches, namely one during each of the following 3 days. Participants were monitored until complete healing of all ulcers. The primary outcome measures were changes since baseline in each lesion's greatest dimension at days 1 and 7, as well as improvement in ulcer-related pain experienced.
Participants were on average about 70 years old, about half were women, and just over 40% had type 2 diabetes. Lesions treated with the hydrogel patch extended between 4.3 and 10.2 mm (mean 7.1 mm) in their greatest dimension, and the smaller lesions receiving usual care were initially 4 mm on average, ranging from 2.0 to 7.0 mm. The hydrogel patch lesions attained 25% to 75% reductions in their greatest lesion extent from baseline to days 1 and 7, respectively, compared to 10% and just over 50% reduction in the lesions that received usual care. Healing rates were similar in patients with and without diabetes. The participants reported significant improvement in pain level 1 day following treatment initiation for 30% of the control lesions, compared to 65% of the lesions treated with the hydrogel patch.
The results of this exploratory study suggest that application of hydrogel patches may represent a novel, effective treatment for accelerating the healing process and pain reduction in mucosal lesions associated with complete dentures also in people with type 2 diabetes; however, larger studies need to confirm these findings.",0
"The objective of this prospective, controlled clinical study was to determine the outcomes of dental implant therapy with staged guided bone regeneration procedures in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Twenty-four patients were included in the study. Half of the patients were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (group 1) while the other half (group 2) of the patients consisted of patients without diabetes. The edentulous maxillary anterior/premolar regions with sufficient vertical height but inadequate horizontal width were treated with staged guided bone regeneration technique and with one or two implant-supported fixed restorations. The patients were followed up at least for 12 months. The parameters that were evaluated were radiographic evaluations on CBCT images and periapical radiographs, histomorphometric analysis, resonance frequency analysis (RFA) and wound-healing parameters. The data were analyzed statistically.
A total of 43 implants were placed in 24 patients (22 implants in group 1 and 21 implants in group 2). The survival rates of implants were 100% for both groups. The success rate of implants was 95% for group 1 and 100% for group 2. None of the parameters including CBCT findings, RFA values, success rates and wound-healing scores showed a significant difference between the two groups.
Staged guided bone regeneration is a feasible augmentation procedure for the treatment of horizontal bone deficiencies of the maxillary anterior/premolar regions in well-controlled type 2 diabetic patients.",0
"We conducted a cross-sectional analysis to evaluate the relationship between serum antibody titers against 19 selected oral microorganisms and measures of hyperglycemia in a large, nationally representative data set. The study population consisted of 7,848 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (1988-1994) who were at least 40 yrs old, with complete serum IgG antibody data against 19 oral microorganisms. The 19 antibody titers were grouped into 4 categories via cluster analysis--orange-red, yellow-orange, orange-blue, and red-green--named to reflect predominant antibody titers against microorganisms in Socransky's classification scheme for oral microbes. Linear regression models weighted for complex survey design were used in which fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, and HbA1c were outcomes and antibody cluster scores were exposures, adjusting for potential confounders. Higher orange-red cluster scores were associated with increased hyperglycemia, while higher orange-blue cluster scores were related with decreased hyperglycemia. A 1-unit-higher orange-red cluster score was associated with 0.46 mg/dL higher fasting blood glucose (p = .0038), and a 1-unit-higher orange-blue cluster score was associated with 0.34% lower HbA1c (p = .0257). Groups of antibody titers against periodontal microorganisms were associated with hyperglycemia independent of known risk factors.",0
"Periodontitis is a common chronic infection of tooth-supporting tissues leading to tooth loss. Two of the major periodontal pathogens are Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Clinically diagnosed periodontitis has been associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS). The aim of the study was to investigate the association of serum antibody levels against A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis and the number of missing teeth with MetS. The population was the PAIS subcohort of the FINRISK '97 study (n = 1,354). The subjects were men aged 45-74 years, and they participated in this cardiovascular risk factor survey in Finland. A total of 534 (39 %) subjects had MetS defined according to the guidelines of the International Diabetes Federation. Serum antibody levels against the pathogens were measured by multiserotype ELISA. A. actinomycetemcomitans antibody levels and the number of missing teeth were significantly higher in subjects with a large waist circumference or with low serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The number of missing teeth was also higher among subjects with a high serum triglyceride concentration or high plasma glucose concentration. Seropositivity for A. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly associated with MetS with an odds ratio (OR) 1.42 (95 % confidence interval 1.09-1.85, p = 0.009). More than four missing teeth and complete edentulousness were also significantly associated with MetS with ORs 1.69 (1.26-2.27, p < 0.001) and 1.93 (1.30-2.86, p = 0.001), respectively. Missing teeth and systemic exposure to A. actinomycetemcomitans were associated with several components of Mets. Infection with this common pathogen or the host response against it is associated with the presence of MetS.",0
"Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a condition, which constitutes a group of risk factors that occur together and increase the risk for Coronary Artery Disease, Stroke and type 2 diabetes mellitus. This disorder is found prevalent in the industrialized societies of the world in epidemic proportions. Periodontitis is an oral disease of microbial origin characterized by loss of attachment apparatus of tooth, resulting in edentulism if untreated. Periodontitis has been attributed to produce a low grade systemic inflammatory condition. The link of periodontitis to various systemic disorders has led to the evolution of a new branch termed as ""periodontal medicine."" Studies reviewed in the present paper have indicated a positive link between the MS and periodontitis and it is suggested that subjects displaying several components of MS should be submitted to periodontal examination. Present studies have displayed coherent relation between the two entities. This review will address the vicious association between MS and periodontitis, depicting the commonality of pathophysiological pathway between the two entities. Systematic reviews, meta-analysis addressing the concerned subject were screened. Whether the systematic periodontal therapy in individuals exhibiting MS has the potential to reduce the incidence of various adverse systemic complications remains a logical proposition. Further, longitudinal and controlled trials with a large population would be imperative to depict the robustness in the association between MS and periodontal disease in human subjects.",0
"OBJECTIVE Shortened leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and diagnosis of periodontitis are associated with an increased risk of complications and mortality in diabetes. This study investigated the association between LTL, endotoxemia, and severity of periodontitis in a large cohort of people with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Six hundred thirty individuals (371 with type 2 and 259 with type 1 diabetes) were recruited from the University College Hospital in London, U.K. During a baseline visit, blood was collected for standard biochemical tests and DNA extraction, while a dental examination was performed to determine diagnosis and extent of periodontitis. LTL was measured by real-time PCR, and endotoxemia was assessed by the limulus amoebocyte lysate method. RESULTS Two hundred fifty-five individuals were diagnosed with gingivitis, 327 with periodontitis (114 with moderate and 213 with severe disease), and 48 with edentulous. Diagnosis of periodontitis was associated with shorter LTL (P = 0.04). A negative association between LTL and endotoxemia was found in the severe periodontitis and type 2 diabetes groups (P = 0.01 for both). Shorter LTL was associated with increased extent of periodontitis (P = 0.01) and increased insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment). Multiple adjustments for biochemical, anthropometric, and medication-use variables did not affect the results. CONCLUSIONS LTL is associated with endotoxemia and diagnosis of periodontitis in people with diabetes. LTL shortening might represent a novel biological pathway accounting for previous epidemiological data that documented higher prevalence of diabetes and its complications in people with periodontitis and vice versa.",0
"The aim of this investigation was to describe the surgical techniques, success rate, prosthetic rehabilitation, complications, and demographics of patients undergoing zygomatic implant surgery.
A retrospective case series study design was implemented that included patients who received zygomatic implants identified in the database of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Universidad El Bosque from 2009 to 2013. Contact information was retrieved from the charts and patients were asked to attend the department for a follow-up appointment. The population consisted of all patients found in the database and the sample included otherwise healthy patients living in Bogota, Colombia. Predictor variables were categorized into patient's medical history, demographics, surgical technique, and prosthetic rehabilitation. The outcome variable was the presence or absence of postoperative complications. Smokers, diabetics, and patients living outside Bogota were excluded. Patients also were excluded if their medical status had changed since zygomatic implant surgery. Descriptive statistics were computed for each study variable.
Data of 95 patients were retrieved. The sample consisted of 80 patients in whom 244 implants were inserted. The sample's mean age was 55.5 years. One hundred eleven zygomatic implants were placed in women and 133 were placed in men, with an overall complication rate of 9.9%, with sinusitis the most frequent complication (7.5%). Other complications included paresthesia (0.4%) and oroantral fistula (0.4%). The follow-up period was 6 to 48 months.
This investigation reviewed the authors' 4-year experience placing zygomatic implants and proved a reliable method for the treatment of the resorbed maxilla.",0
"In the context of population aging, multimorbidity has emerged as a growing concern in public health. However, little is known about multimorbidity patterns and other issues surrounding chronic diseases. The aim of our study was to examine multimorbidity patterns, the relationship between physical and mental conditions and the distribution of multimorbidity in the Spanish adult population.
Data from this cross-sectional study was collected from the COURAGE study. A total of 4,583 participants from Spain were included, 3,625 aged over 50. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted to detect multimorbidity patterns in the population over 50 years of age. Crude and adjusted binary logistic regressions were performed to identify individual associations between physical and mental conditions.
THREE MULTIMORBIDITY PATTERNS ROSE: 'cardio-respiratory' (angina, asthma, chronic lung disease), 'mental-arthritis' (arthritis, depression, anxiety) and the 'aggregated pattern' (angina, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, cataracts, edentulism, arthritis). After adjusting for covariates, asthma, chronic lung disease, arthritis and the number of physical conditions were associated with depression. Angina and the number of physical conditions were associated with a higher risk of anxiety. With regard to multimorbidity distribution, women over 65 years suffered from the highest rate of multimorbidity (67.3%).
Multimorbidity prevalence occurs in a high percentage of the Spanish population, especially in the elderly. There are specific multimorbidity patterns and individual associations between physical and mental conditions, which bring new insights into the complexity of chronic patients. There is need to implement patient-centered care which involves these interactions rather than merely paying attention to individual diseases.",0
"This short-term prospective study evaluated the clinical outcome of unsplinted implants retaining a mandibular overdenture with magnetic attachments in controlled type 2 diabetic patients.
Twenty-eight completely edentulous patients (18 men and 10 women) with controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus received a total of 56 implants (two per patient) in the canine region of the mandible using the standardized two-stage surgical protocol. All patients complained of insufficient retention of their mandibular denture. New maxillary complete dentures and mandibular overdentures were fabricated. Overdentures were connected to the implants with magnetic attachments. Each implant was evaluated at the time of prosthetic loading, and 6, 12, and 24 months thereafter. Clinical evaluation was performed using Gingival Index (GI), Plaque Index (PI), probing depth (PD), implant stability (ISQ), and vertical bone loss (VBLO). Cumulative success and survival rates were calculated using life table analysis.
After 2 years of overdenture insertion, there was a significant increase in PI, GI, PD, and VBLO. ISQ decreased significantly after 6 months of loading then increased again after 2 years. The cumulative survival and success rates of the implants were 91% and 87.5% respectively.
Within the limitations of this study, the clinical outcome of unsplinted implants retaining a mandibular overdenture with magnetic attachments in controlled type 2 diabetic patients was favorable after 2 years. However, long-term randomized controlled trials are needed to compare the clinical outcome of unsplinted implants in diabetic and nondiabetic patients.",0
"In past 50 years, type 2 diabetes has emerged as one of the major public health problem. India leads the world with the largest number of diabetic patients and has a huge elderly population. The present article discusses the effect of diabetes and edentulism on the overall general health of elderly. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes and edentulism in Indian elderly and their inter-relationship has been discussed. Dentists must provide optimum oral care with special attention towards comprehensive periodontal management and oral hygiene awareness among diabetics to prevent tooth loss. Dental and medical professionals can improve patient management of the oral and overall effects of diabetes by implementing various awareness programs; organizing camps; distributing informative pamphlets and dietary counseling. Dentists can detect undiagnosed cases of diabetes and refer patients to physicians for further evaluation and management.",0
"To compare prevalence of systemic health conditions (SHC) between African American and Caucasian edentulous patients presenting for complete dentures (CD) at an urban dental school.
The study included patients presenting for CD 1/1-12/31/2010, ages 20 to 64 years, and either African American or Caucasian. Covariates included: age group, gender, employment status, Medicaid status, smoking history, and alcohol consumption. SHC included at least one of the following: arthritis, asthma, cancer, diabetes, emphysema, heart attack, heart murmur, heart surgery, hypertension, or stroke.
The group (n = 88) was 44.3% African American, 65.9% ≥50, 45.5% male, 22.7% employed, and 67.0% with at least one SHC. African Americans were older (p = 0.001) and more likely to have one or more SHC (p = 0.011). Patients with at least one SHC were older (p = 0.018) and more likely female (p = 0.012). The total sample logistic regression model assessing SHC yielded only gender as statistically significant (males < OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.92). Caucasian males were less likely to have SHC (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.77), and Caucasians ≥50 were more likely (OR 5.36, 95% CI 1.19 to 24.08). African Americans yielded no significant associations.
Among selected completely edentulous denture patients at an urban dental school, two out of three patients had at least one SHC. This exploratory study suggests there may be health status differences between African American and Caucasian patients in this setting, calling for further study.",0
"To test whether the number of teeth, an inverse proxy for composite oral infection scores is associated with better survival.
The Kuopio Oral Health and Heart study initiated a case-control study in 1995-1996 consisting of 256 consecutive coronary artery disease patients and 250 age and gender-matched controls. We appended the mortality data and formulated a longitudinal study. By May 31st, 2011, 124 mortalities had occurred and 80 of which were of cardiovascular origin. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we assessed the association of the teeth group (Teethgrp) - consisting of 10 teeth - with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality after 15.8 years of median follow-up.
In multivariate models, with the edentulous state as reference, one level increase in Teethgrp was associated with significantly increased survival from cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality with a Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.73, p-value = 0.02 but not with all-cause mortality (HR = 0.87, p = 0.13). The findings were not mediated by C-reactive protein (CRP) levels ≥3 mg/L or by median fibrinogen levels, but were mediated by CRP levels >5 mg/L.
Each increment of 10 teeth from the edentulous state was associated with a 27% improved CVD survival, independent of low-grade systemic inflammation.",0
"It has not been established to what extent oral health is associated with cognitive function in late middle-aged adults. In this study, which is part of the national Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, the authors investigated whether tooth loss and periodontitis are associated with lower cognitive function.
The authors analyzed ARIC data measuring cognitive function in 11,097 participants from 1996 through 1998 according to tests of delayed word recall, digit-symbol substitution (DSS) and word fluency; 9,874 participants answered dental screening questions. Of the 8,554 dentate participants, 5,942 received oral examinations. The authors used measures of dental status, number of teeth and periodontitis (classified according to the Biofilm-Gingival Interface Index) in multiple linear regression models to estimate these factors' cross-sectional association with cognitive scores, adjusting for sociodemographic factors, cigarette smoking, alcohol use and diabetes.
Approximately 13 percent of participants were edentulous. Of the dentate participants, 27.3 percent had fewer than 20 teeth and 12.4 percent had pocket depth of 4 millimeters or more with severe bleeding. Compared with dentate participants, edentulous participants had lower scores for all cognitive tests. Among the dentate participants, having fewer teeth and gingival bleeding were associated with lower DSS and word fluency test scores, although periodontal pocket depth was not.
In this cohort, edentulism was correlated with lower cognitive status. Tooth loss and gingival bleeding were markers of poorer executive function among dentate people. Practical Implications. The association of lower cognitive scores with edentulism suggests that past oral diseases may be a risk indicator for cognitive decline, whereas the association with gingival inflammation indicates a possible effect of cognitive decline on oral health. Practitioners should be aware that both current and historical markers of oral disease might be associated with decline in cognitive function, even in adults of late middle age.",0
"In chronic kidney disease (CKD), inadequate nutritional intake, inflammation, and increased oxidative stress have been the major contributing factors in malnutrition pathogenesis. However, there is still a paucity of evidence assessing the magnitude of the effect of tooth loss on malnutrition in CKD populations. The authors hypothesize that among patients with CKD, tooth loss may affect nutritional status, using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1988 to 1994 (NHANES III).
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated based on cystatin C levels using the relevant equation. Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (albuminuria) was calculated in milligrams per gram with a cutoff point of 30 mg/g. CKD was defined based on estimated GFR <60 mL/minute/1.73m(2) and albuminuria ≥30 mg/g. The cutoff point for serum albumin was set at 3.7 g/dL. Tooth loss categories were based on the number of missing and replaced teeth.
A total of 2,749 patients was included and stratified based on their oral health status. There was a statistically significant correlation between tooth loss and the proportion of patients with low protein and caloric intake (P = 0.02 and 0.01, respectively). Serum albumin reached a frequency peak in the fully edentulous group without dentures (group 4, 19.2%). In the same group, individuals had lower protein (30.1%) and caloric intake (30.2%) (P = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). Furthermore, logistic regression analysis confirmed the significant role of tooth loss on serum albumin and protein and energy intake in this population even after adjusting for confounding variables.
Tooth loss independently predicts low energy and protein intake, as well as serum albumin levels, biomarkers of malnutrition in CKD.",0
"In COPD patients, fatal and non-fatal respiratory-related events are influenced by age, severity of respiratory disease, and comorbidities.
Analyze the effects of edentulism, periodontal disease and systemic biomarkers of inflammation on the occurrence of serious fatal and non-fatal respiratory-related events among subjects with COPD.
Cases were identified from Dental Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. Edentulism was defined as study participants without any natural teeth or implants. Participants with one or more natural teeth (comprising 11,378 subjects) were studied as dentate subjects. Periodontal disease status among dentate individuals was determined using the consensus definitions published by the joint Center for Disease Control/American Association of Periodontology working group). Adjusted Hazard Models are developed to evaluate the relationship between edentulism/periodontal disease and COPD Related Events. Models were then stratified by GOLD Stage I, II and III/IV. Serum biomarkers were also evaluated to explore the effect of systemic inflammation.
A statistically significant association was found between oral health status and COPD-related events, even adjusting for conditions such as hypertension, smoking and diabetes. Edentulous individuals who had been diagnosed with COPD had a higher incidence and were at greater risk of having a COPD related event (hospitalization and death) than individuals who had teeth and whose mouths had healthy periodontal status. However, being edentulous did not convey excess risk for COPD-related events for those study participants who were classified as GOLD III/IV at baseline. Finally, we showed that individuals who had levels of serum IL-6 in the highest two quartiles were at even higher risk for COPD-related events.
These findings suggest that the risk for COPD-related events after adjusting for potential confounders may be attributable to both edentulism and elevated serum IL-6 levels.",0
"The possible association between oral infection and chronic inflammation and cardiovascular disease risk has been studied intensively. The present study is designed to determine the strength of association between edentulism and angina pectoris in Mexican adults aged 35 years and older.
Using the tools and sampling strategies of the World Health Survey of the World Health Organization, cross-sectional data were collected in Mexico in the National Performance Assessment Survey (probabilistic, multistage, and cluster sampling). Dental information was available for 20 of the 32 states of Mexico. Angina and edentulism are self-reported in this study. Statistical analysis was performed using binary logistic regression adjusting for complex samples.
A total of 13,966 participants, representing a population of 29,853,607 individuals, were included. Of the complete study population, 3,052,263 (10.2%) were completely toothless, and 673,810 (2.3%) were diagnosed with angina pectoris. After adjusting for smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes, body mass index, and sex, the effect of edentulism on angina was modified by age (interaction), being more marked in the younger age group (odds ratio [OR] = exp(2.5597) =12.93) than in the older individuals surveyed (OR = exp(2.5597 + (-0.0334)) =12.51). Additionally, low physical activity (OR = 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03 to 2.22) and higher socioeconomic status (OR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.90) were more likely to be associated with angina pectoris.
Overall, the results of this study, conducted in a representative sample of Mexican adults, suggest that an association exists between edentulism and angina pectoris. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanism for this association.",0
"We have conducted a longitudinal study to quantify biofilms in oral clinical isolates of Candida species (spp.) from adults with local and systemic predisposing factors for candidiasis. A total of 69 yeast isolates from 63 Mexican patients were evaluated. These isolates (39 C. albicans, 15 C. tropicalis, 7 C. glabrata, 4 C. krusei, 1 C. lusitaniae, 1 C. kefyr, 1 C. guilliermondii and 1 C. pulcherrima) were obtained from two clinical sites: 62.3% (n=43) from the oral mucosa of totally and partially edentulous patients, and 37.7% (n=26) from the oral mucosa of diabetics. In addition, Candida ATCC strains were used as controls for each experiment. The kinetics of biofilm formation were measured by 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide [XTT] reduction; each isolate was tested at 6, 12 and 24h. Biofilm formation is dependent on the Candida spp. and its clinical origin. On average, the oral isolates of C. glabrata are strong biofilm producers, whereas C. albicans and C. tropicalis are moderate producers. The most common species in our population was C. albicans. While the kinetics of C. albicans biofilm formation varies between oral isolates, it generally maintains steady growth from 2 to 48h, when it reaches its maximum growth.",0
"This study was undertaken to compare the bone density in nondiabetic and controlled type II diabetes patients using spiral computed tomography. A group of 40 edentulous men, comprising of 20 nondiabetics and 20 controlled type II diabetics between the ages of 50-65 years, were enrolled in the study. Glycemic control of the diabetic patients was assessed by glycosylated hemoglobin level. The controlled diabetic group had an HbA1c level between 6.1-8%. A radiographic stent was prepared by using chemically cured resin. Bone densities at trabecular, buccal, and lingual cortical regions of maxillary and mandibular edentulous arches were measured by a tomography machine. Mean bone density measurements were recorded in Hounsfield units. The data thus obtained from 10 sites of maxillary and mandibular arches were tabulated and analyzed using SPSS statistical software. This study showed no significant changes in bone density between the controlled diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. Within the limitation of this study, it can be concluded that bone density does not seem to be affected in controlled type II diabetics.",0
"Chronic diseases (e.g., heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes) are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Engaging in healthy behaviors (e.g., quitting smoking and tobacco use, being more physically active, and eating a nutritious diet) and accessing preventive health-care services (e.g., routine physical checkups, screening for cancer, checking blood pressure, testing blood cholesterol, and receiving recommended vaccinations) can reduce morbidity and mortality from chronic and infectious disease and lower medical costs. Monitoring and evaluating health-risk behaviors and the use of health services is essential to developing intervention programs, promotion strategies, and health policies that address public health at multiple levels, including state, territory, metropolitan and micropolitan statistical area (MMSA), and county.
January-December 2010.
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an ongoing, state-based, random-digit-dialed telephone survey of noninstitutionalized adults aged ≥18 years residing in the United States. BRFSS collects data on health-risk behaviors, chronic diseases and conditions, access to health care, and use of preventive health services and practices related to the leading causes of death and disabilities in the United States. This report presents results for 2010 for all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, 192 MMSAs, and 302 counties.

Adults aged ≥45 years who have had a stroke: 2.4%-7.1% for states and territories, 2.3%-8.8% for MSMAs, and 1.7%-8.8% for counties.
The findings in this report indicate substantial variations in the health-risk behaviors, chronic diseases and conditions, access to health-care services, and the use of the preventive health services among U.S. adults at the state and territory, MMSA, and county levels. Healthy People 2010 (HP 2010) objectives were established to monitor health behaviors, conditions, and the use of preventive health services for the first decade of the 2000s. The findings in this report indicate that many of the HP 2010 objectives were not achieved by 2010. The findings underscore the continued need for surveillance of health-risk behaviors, chronic diseases, and conditions and of the use of preventive health-care services.
Local and state health departments and federal agencies use BRFSS data to identify populations at high risk for certain health-risk behaviors, chronic diseases, and conditions and to evaluate the use of preventive health-care services. BRFSS data also are used to direct, implement, monitor, and evaluate public health programs and policies that can lead to a reduction in morbidity and mortality from chronic conditions and corresponding health-risk behaviors.",0
"To explore the factors associated with the numbers of remaining teeth among type 2 diabetes community residents.
Promoting oral health is an important nursing role for patients with diabetes, especially in disadvantaged areas. However, limited research has been carried out on the relationship between numbers of remaining teeth, diabetes-related biomarkers and personal oral hygiene among diabetic rural residents.
A cross-sectional, descriptive design with a simple random sample was used.
This study was part of a longitudinal cohort study of health promotion for preventing diabetic foot among rural community diabetic residents. It was carried out in 18 western coastal and inland districts of Chiayi County in central Taiwan. In total, 703 participants were enrolled in this study.
The findings indicated that a high percentage of the participants (26%) had no remaining natural teeth. Nearly three quarters (74%) had fewer than 20 natural teeth. After controlling for the potential confounding factors, multivariate analysis demonstrated that the factors determining numbers of remaining teeth were age (p < 0.001), education (p < 0.001), using dental floss (p = 0.003), ankle brachial pressure index (p = 0.028), waist circumference (p = 0.024) and HbA1C (p = 0.033).
Except for some unmodifiable factors, the factors most significantly associated with numbers of remaining teeth were less tooth-brushing with dental floss, abnormal ankle brachial pressure and poor glycemic control.
This study highlights the importance of nursing intervention in oral hygiene for patients with type 2 diabetes. It is necessary to initiate oral health promotion activities when diabetes is first diagnosed, especially for older diabetic residents of rural or coastal areas who are poorly educated.",0
"The authors conducted an analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to understand the association between diabetes and tooth loss in the United States.
The authors analyzed the oral examination and self-reported diabetes data obtained from the NHANES 2003-2004 cycle and included 2,508 participants representing a civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population 50 years and older. The authors calculated the prevalence of edentulism and the number of missing teeth among dentate people, and they used multiple regression analyses to assess the association between diabetes and tooth loss.
The prevalence of edentulism was 28 percent and 14 percent among people with and without diabetes, respectively. The multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that people with diabetes were more likely to be edentulous than were those without diabetes (adjusted odds ratio = 2.25; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.19-4.21). Among dentate adults, those with diabetes had a higher number of missing teeth than did adults without diabetes (mean [standard error {SE}] = 9.8 [0.67]), mean [SE] = 6.7 [0.29]); P < .01).
These study results revealed that adults with diabetes are at higher risk of experiencing tooth loss and edentulism than are adults without diabetes. One of every five cases of edentulism in the United States is linked to diabetes. Practical Implications. Although the association between diabetes and periodontal disease is well established, health care professionals also need to recognize the risk of tooth loss and its effect on quality of life among people with diabetes.",0
"Oral health is an integral component of overall health and well-being. Very little Rhode Island state-level information exists on the determinants of tooth loss. The objective of this study was to systematically identify sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors, health conditions and disabilities, and dental insurance coverage associated with tooth loss among noninstitutionalized adults in Rhode Island.
We analyzed Rhode Island's 2008 and 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey data in 2011. The survey had 4 response categories for tooth loss: none, 1 to 5, 6 or more but not all, and all. We used multinomial logistic regression models to assess the relationship between 4 risk factor domains and tooth loss.
An estimated 57.6% of Rhode Island adults had all their teeth, 28.9% had 1 to 5 missing teeth, 8.9% had 6 to 31 missing teeth, and 4.6% were edentulous. Respondents who had low income, low education, unhealthy behaviors (ie, were former or current smokers and did not engage in physical activity), chronic conditions (ie, diabetes and obesity) or disabilities, and no dental insurance coverage were more likely to have fewer teeth compared with their referent groups. However, the association of these variables with tooth loss was not uniform by age group.
Adults who report risky health behaviors or impaired health may be considered target subpopulations for prevention of tooth loss and promotion of good oral health.",0
"A bidirectional relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM) and periodontal diseases (PDs) has been established. It is estimated that patients with poorly controlled DM are 3 times more likely to develop chronic PD compared with normoglycemic individuals despite similar composition in subgingival biofilms. Furthermore, these patients present with increased severity and rapid progression of attachment loss around teeth resulting in edentulism. Treatment of PD results in a modest but significant improvement in glycemic control in patients with DM reflected by a 0.4 % reduction in HbA1c-glycated hemoglobin levels. Compelling evidence from in vitro and animal studies supports a plausible biological explanation for the relationship between the 2 conditions centered on systemic low-grade inflammation. However, the limited number of comparable large randomized clinical trials is reflected in the limited specific guidelines offered by the international organizations for DM and PD regarding the management of the 2 diseases in an individual.",0
"The present review aims to discuss the last 10 years published data on the topic of the use of osseointegrated implants in diabetic subjects, particularly regarding the influence of antibiotics administration in the perioperative period.
In the last decades, oral rehabilitation significantly has evolved particularly with the use of osseointegrated implants. Increased life expectation of population is reflecting in a greater number of diabetic patients who might require dental osseointegrated implants rehabilitation. Diabetes was considered for a long time as a contraindication for oral implant placement. In this context, the use of antibiotics is still a controversial factor when we correlate it to implant success rate.
Although 228 articles were initially selected for evaluation of proposed criteria, only 16 articles were considered valid. Among the 16 selected articles, only six articles represented clinical research that discussed the influence of the antibiotic in the success of osseointegration of dental implants in diabetic subjects. Five were retrospective studies and one a prospective research.
Data favors the use of antibiotics without significant side effects but clinical investigations of the need of prophylaxis antibiotic or therapeutic antibiotics are still scarce. The lack of adequate methodology is one of the main problems of the current articles. It is important to emphasize that studies should present detailed methodology in order to allow reproducibility.
Permanent tooth loss is a pathological condition that affects millions of people worldwide. The possibility of successful treatment of edentulous areas through osseointegrated implants in those systemic compromised patients is a matter of scientific discussion. Although antimicrobial agents must be used rationally and carefully to avoid development of bacterial resistance, more studies are needed in order to support evidence regarding the influence of antibiotics in the success of dental implant surgery in diabetic patients.",0
"We examined the potential association between prior chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and edentulism, and whether the association varied by COPD severity using data from the Dental Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study.
Cross-sectional.
Community dwelling subjects from four US communities.
Cases were identified as edentulous (without teeth) and subjects with one or more natural teeth were identified as dentate. COPD cases were defined by spirometry measurements that showed the ratio of forced expiratory volume (1 s) to vital capacity to be less than 0.7. The severity of COPD cases was also determined using a modified Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease classification criteria (GOLD stage I-IV). Multiple logistic regression was used to examine the association between COPD and edentulism, while adjusting for age, gender, centre/race, ethnicity, education level, income, diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease and congestive heart failure, body mass index, smoking, smokeless tobacco use and alcohol consumption.
13 465 participants were included in this analysis (2087 edentulous; 11 378 dentate). Approximately 28.3% of edentulous participants had prior COPD compared with 19.6% among dentate participants (p<0.0001). After adjustment for potential confounders, we observed a 1.3 (1.08 to 1.62) and 2.5 (1.68 to 3.63) fold increased risk of edentulism among GOLD II and GOLD III/IV COPD, respectively, as compared with the non-COPD/dentate referent. Given the short period of time between the measurements of COPD (visit 2) and dentate status (visit 4) relative to the natural history of both diseases, neither temporality nor insight as to the directionality of the association can be ascertained.
We found a statistically significant association between prior COPD and edentulism, with evidence of a positive incremental effect seen with increasing GOLD classification.",0
"The subjects in this retrospective case series were derived from a review of 700 patient files within the implant practice of the Department of Periodontology, University Hospital, Catholic University of Leuven. Inclusion criteria were met by 412 patients (240 females, 172 males) receiving a total of 1514 Nobel Biocare dental implants. These patients were included based on data availability for the time period 2 years after abutment surgery (considered to represent late implant failure).
Given the concern of the authors to assess the probability of late implant failure among clinic patients with certain local and systemic factors, the potential factors were multiple. The local factors included the following: implant length and diameter, bone quality and quantity, insertion site, type of edentulism, antibiotic use perioperatively, dehiscence and/or perforation of the site during surgery, and stability at insertion (measured by Periotest values). The related health and behavioral factors included the following: medications, smoking (<10 cigarettes/day, 10-20 cigarettes/day, >20 cigarettes/day), hypertension, ischemic cardiac problems, coagulation anomalies, gastric ulcers, thyroid disorders, hypercholesterolemia, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, diabetes (types 1 and 2), Crohn's disease, and chemotherapy.
The primary outcome was described as ""late implant failure."" The current study, which follows a similar study on early implant failure,(1) aims to identify negative influences on maintenance of integration. The authors used the clinical experience related to the 412 patients with 1514 implants to identify whether the observed failure rates were influenced by local and systemic factors. Failure was defined as ""late"" when occurring between abutment connection surgery and 2 years after this date. Patients/implants that were not available for this interval of time were not included. However, even when records were available, not all patient records provided all data sought.
Regarding local factors, the authors reported that implant diameter and location were relevant to late implant loss, whereas implant length was not (P value = .01, = .34, respectively; univariate generalized estimating equation [GEE] logistic regression). Regarding implant diameter, significantly more loss was noted for 5.00-mm implants when compared with the 4.00-mm or 4.75-mm implants. Failure related to location revealed that the maxilla compared with the mandible, posterior jaws compared with anterior jaws, and the posterior maxilla compared with all other oral locations were associated with more late failures (Table 1). Assessment of systemic factors revealed radiotherapy to be related to more late implant loss (P = .003). Neither systemic disease nor smoking exposure was associated with late failure.
The authors concluded that late implant failure was influenced by the local factor ""implant location"" and the systemic factor ""radiotherapy."" Neither smoking nor systemic health factors were found to adversely influence implant integration from abutment connection through 2 years' performance.",0
"Periodontitis is a primarily bacterial infection that is common in dentate individuals, while denture stomatitis is a predominantly fungal infection that is common among denture wearers. Both infections may increase a patient's risk for chronic systemic infection dissemination, and may in turn increase the risk of chronic, inflammatory-based systemic diseases. Systemic diseases for which chronic oral infections are believed to confer attributable risk include atherosclerotic and coronary disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and hypertension. It appears that invasive oral pathogens trigger a systemic inflammatory response via mediators released by the cardiovascular system and liver, putting the patient at increased risk for these diseases. Data comparing gene expression between denture wearers with and without denture stomatitis (and associated Candida albicans infections) has demonstrated unique up- and down-regulation patterns for a number of genes. It appears that down-regulated genes (whose functions are thereby diminished) are associated with reduced epithelial barrier integrity. By contrast, there appears to be an association between up-regulated genes (which have enhanced function) and inflammatory responses that facilitate the ability of C. albicans to bind with and penetrate the oral mucosa. Molecular biological approaches suggest that future therapeutic development could target reducing either the local inflammatory processor, the binding and attachment of C. albicans to the oral mucosa, or both. Ongoing investigations are attempting to incorporate interventions into matrices, to provide a local and sustained presence to therapeutic interventions.",0
"Due to the increasing number of older people, there is a need for studies focused on this population. The aims of the present study are to assess oral and systemic conditions in individuals aged 60 to 95 years with access to dental insurance.
Probing depths (PDs), tooth loss, alveolar bone levels, and systemic health were studied among a representative cohort of older individuals.
A total of 1,147 individuals in young-old (aged 60 or 67 years), old (aged 72 or 78 years), and old-old (aged ≥81 years) age groups were enrolled, including 200 individuals who were edentulous, in this study. Annual dental care was received by 82% of dentate individuals. Systemic diseases were common (diabetes: 5.8%; cardiovascular diseases: 20.7%; obesity: 71.2%; elevated C-reactive protein [CRP]: 98.4%). Serum CRP values were unrelated to periodontal conditions. Rates of periodontitis, defined as ≥30% of sites with a distance from cemento-enamel junction to bone of ≥5 mm, were 11.2% in women in the young-old age group and 44.9% in men in the old-old age group. Individuals in older age groups had a higher likelihood of periodontitis defined by bone loss and cutoff levels of PD ≥5 mm (odds ratio: 1.8; 95% confidence interval: 1.2 to 2.5; P <0.01). A total of 7% of individuals in the old-old age group had ≥20 teeth and no periodontitis. Systemic diseases, dental use, or smoking were not explanatory, whereas age and sex were explanatory for periodontitis.
The prevalence of periodontitis increased with age. Sex seems to be the dominant explanatory factor for periodontitis in older individuals. Despite frequent dental visits, overall oral health in the oldest age cohort was poor.",0
"The theory of focal infection, which was promulgated during the 19(th) and early 20(th) centuries, stated that ""foci"" of sepsis were responsible for the initiation and progression of a variety of inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, peptic ulcers, and appendicitis. In the oral cavity, therapeutic edentulation was common as a result of the popularity of the focal infection theory. Since many teeth were extracted without evidence of infection, thereby providing no relief of symptoms, the theory was discredited and largely ignored for many years. Recent progress in classification and identification of oral microorganisms and the realization that certain microorganisms are normally found only in the oral cavity have opened the way for a more realistic assessment of the importance of oral focal infection. It has become increasingly clear that the oral cavity can act as the site of origin for dissemination of pathogenic organisms to distant body sites, especially in immunocompromised hosts such as patients suffering from malignancies, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, or in patients undergoing other immunosuppressive treatment. A number of epidemiological studies have suggested that oral infection, especially periodontitis, may be a risk factor for systemic diseases.",0
"Healing of tooth extraction sockets in poorly controlled diabetic patients is often delayed and accompanied by severe infection. The exact cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of this complication are still not fully understood.
The purpose of this study was to investigate molecular changes associated with delayed oral wound healing in diabetes.
Six to eight weeks old male type 2 diabetes and age matched control inbred mice were used and maxillary molar tooth extractions were performed. At 4 and 7 days after tooth extraction, the edentulous mucosa of the mice were harvested, and analyzed for histology and gene expression of key wound healing factors.
In the diabetic model, histological analysis showed that epithelial tissue migration for wound closure was delayed after tooth extraction compared to the control. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that expression of the TGF-β1, TGF-β2, TGF-β3, TGFβRII and TGFβRIII genes was significantly downregulated in the diabetic model at 4 and 7 days after tooth extraction.
These results suggest that delayed wound healing of oral mucosa in diabetes may be associated with decreased expression levels of these regulatory genes which play important roles in controlling epithelial wound closure.",0
"To investigate the prevalence of dry mouth in a select sample of edentulous Jordanian older population wearing complete dentures and to evaluate its impact on oral functions.
The prevalence and impact of Xerostomia as a cofactor in causing denture problems in Jordanians have not been previously investigated.
This study included 455 participants (253 men and 202 women). Perception of dry mouth was measured by a pilot-tested questionnaire. Xerostomic status was confirmed clinically. Complete denture function was also assessed.
One hundred and thirty six subjects (29.9%) had reported a subjective feeling of dry mouth with a prevalence of 24.9% in men (n = 63) and 36.1% in women (n = 73) (p < 0.01). 136 of the 145 subjects with satisfactory dentures showed one or more signs suggestive of Xerostomia. The majority of xerostomic participants with different sets of complete dentures were dissatisfied with oral functions (p < 0.05). There was a significant association between dry mouth and increasing age, female gender and smoking status (p < 0.05).
Among complete denture wearers, Xerostomia is significantly more prevalent in women and associated with increased age and smoking. Xerostomia adversely affects oral functions and overall satisfaction with dentures.",0
"Chronic diseases are accelerating globally, advancing across all regions and pervading all socioeconomic classes. Unhealthy diet and poor nutrition, physical inactivity, tobacco use, excessive use of alcohol and psychosocial stress are the most important risk factors. Periodontal disease is a component of the global burden of chronic disease, and chronic disease and periodontal disease have the same essential risk factors. In addition, severe periodontal disease is related to poor oral hygiene and to poor general health (e.g. the presence of diabetes mellitus and other systemic diseases). The present report highlights the global burden of periodontal disease: the ultimate burden of periodontal disease (tooth loss), as well as signs of periodontal disease, are described from World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiological data. High prevalence rates of complete tooth loss are found in upper middle-income countries, whereas the tooth-loss rates, at the time of writing, are modest for low-income countries. In high-income countries somewhat lower rates for edentulism are found when compared with upper middle-income countries. Around the world, social inequality in tooth loss is profound within countries. The Community Periodontal Index was introduced by the WHO in 1987 for countries to produce periodontal health profiles and to assist countries in the planning and evaluation of intervention programs. Globally, gingival bleeding is the most prevalent sign of disease, whereas the presence of deep periodontal pockets (≥6 mm) varies from 10% to 15% in adult populations. Intercountry and intracountry variations are found in the prevalence of periodontal disease, and these variations relate to socio-environmental conditions, behavioral risk factors, general health status of people (e.g. diabetes and HIV status) and oral health systems. National public health initiatives for the control and prevention of periodontal disease should include oral health promotion and integrated disease-prevention strategies based on common risk-factor approaches. Capacity building of oral health systems must consider the establishment of a financially fair service in periodontal care. Health systems research is needed for the evaluation of population-oriented oral health programs.",0
"To investigate whether tooth loss is associated with increased blood pressure among adults after controlling for socioeconomic, health, and lifestyle confounders. We also assessed the interactions between tooth loss and smoking status and tooth loss and age on systolic blood pressure (SBP).
A population-based cross-sectional study was carried out with 1720 adults from Florianópolis, Brazil. Data collection included blood pressure, anthropometric measures, and a questionnaire on socio-demographics, self-rated health, diabetes, self-reported number of natural teeth, and dental prosthesis. We used linear multivariable regression models for the association of blood pressure with tooth loss adjusting for potential confounders.
Edentulous subjects had a SBP 8.3 mmHg (95% CI 0.1; 16.7) higher than those with more than 10 teeth in both arches after adjustment for potential confounders. We found interaction between tooth loss and smoking status. Moderate/heavy smokers were associated with considerably higher SBP than light, former or non-smokers among edentulous and also partly among dentate with less than 10 teeth in at least one arch, but there was no real association between smoking and SBP among those with 10 or more teeth in both arches.
Total tooth loss is associated with increased levels of SBP in this adult population.",0
"To determine the strength of association of type 2 diabetes mellitus and periodontal disease with the oral inflammatory burden, as assessed by markers of inflammation in saliva.
Unstimulated saliva samples were collected from 192 subjects with or without type 2 diabetes. β-glucuronidase (βG) was measured via a fluorometric array and interlukin-1β (IL-1β) via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The concentration of both mediators was evaluated in relationship to clinical parameters, severity of periodontal disease and diabetes status.
Regression analysis demonstrated that diabetes and periodontal disease was independently and positively correlated with increased concentration of βG in saliva (p < 0.001). Moreover, the relative association of periodontal disease with the level of βG in saliva was greater than the strength of association of the diabetic status. IL-1β concentration in saliva was primarily associated with the severity of periodontal disease (p < 0.01), but not the presence of diabetes (p = 0.50).
This study examined the nature of the inflammatory response in the oral cavity as assessed by inflammatory markers in saliva. Both periodontal disease and diabetes mellitus were independently associated with the oral inflammatory burden, in which the effect of periodontal disease was more pronounced.",0
"Type 2 diabetes and tooth loss are linked both epidemiologically and pathophysiologically. We applied label-free differential protein expression analysis using multidimensional liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS) to explore the proteomic profile of saliva samples collected from selected type 2 diabetic edentulous patients and non-diabetic controls. Ninety-six peptides corresponding to 52 proteins were differentially expressed between the diabetic edentulous patients and controls (p < 0.05). Some diabetes-related inflammatory biomarkers including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and serum amyloid A were detected with levels increased in diabetic samples. Other biomarkers including amylase, palate, lung and nasal epithelium associated protein (PLUNC), and serotransferrin levels were decreased in diabetic samples. In contrast with previous findings, salivary carbonic anhydrase 6 and alpha-2 macroglobulin levels, however, were decreased in this diabetic patient population. Cluster analysis and principle component analysis demonstrated a differential pattern of protein biomarker expression between diabetic and control subjects. Western blot analysis was completed to confirm the relatively lower expression level of two biomarkers, including PLUNC and amylase in the diabetic group compared to control subjects. The presence of salivary biomarkers specific for diabetes in edentulous subjects mimics those in serum, especially those related to inflammatory/lipid metabolism. While this exploratory study requires further validation with a larger population, it provides proof-of-principle for salivary proteomics for edentulous subjects with diabetes.",0
"Common risk factors of periodontitis and cardiovascular diseases fuel the debate on interrelationships between them. The aim is to prove whether statins may influence periodontal parameters by affecting either of these factors. Out of the 4,290 subjects of SHIP (Study of Health in Pomerania), we included subjects aged >30 years (219 with statins, 2937 without) and excluded edentulous. We determined periodontal measures, cholesterol fractions, and inflammation markers. Statin use and periodontal risk factors were assessed. Gingival plaque and periodontal attachment loss were associated with systemic LDL cholesterol (P < 0.001) and C-reactive protein CRP (P = 0.019) revealing interaction with statin use. When adjusted for age, sex, smoking, diabetes, education, and dental service, statins were identified as effect modifiers abolishing the relationship between attachment loss and LDL and between gingival plaque and LDL (interactions P < 0.001). No statin-related interaction was detected with increase in CRP. The interaction supports the view of inter-relationships between periodontal and systemic inflammatory mediators.",0
"The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential for a chemically modified Sand blasted, Large grit, Acid etched (SLA) surface, compared with a conventional SLA surface, to enhance implant healing and integration in poorly controlled diabetic patients, a group previously demonstrated to have compromises and delays in implant stabilization during the metabolically active healing period following implant placement.
The study enrolled 24 patients with type 2 diabetes, baseline HbA1c levels between 7.5-11.4%, and a minimum of two posterior mandibular tooth sites at least 4 months following extraction and appropriate for implant placement. Each patient, at a randomly selected site, received an implant with the conventional SLA surface; at the second site, the patient received an implant with the chemically modified SLA (modSLA) surface. Thus, 48 study implants were placed. Implant stability was assessed using Resonance Frequency Analysis (RFA). Readings were taken from the buccal and proximal directions for each implant. Implant stability (ISQ) was assessed at the time of surgical placement (baseline) and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 16 weeks following implant placement.
No significant differences in implant stability were observed between conventional SLA implants and modSLA implants, and the time courses of implant stabilization following implant placement were similar for the two implant types. Baseline ISQ and minimum ISQ was slightly higher in subjects with higher HbA1c levels, but were similar during 12-16 weeks following implant placement. Forty-seven (98%) of the 48 implants were determined to be successfully osseointegrated and continued to restoration.
Implant stabilization was similar for the conventional SLA and chemically modified SLA implants in type 2 diabetic patients with relatively poor glycemic control. Furthermore, this study demonstrated clinically successful implant placement even in poorly controlled diabetic patients.",0
"Obesity and edentulism are both associated with multiple systemic disorders with an inflammatory background including periodontal diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the different impact of obesity on inflammation in dentate and toothless subjects. The data came from the population-based, cross-sectional study SHIP (Study of Health in Pomerania). We determined anthropometric measures including BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), diagnostic periodontal parameters, and systemic metabolites. It was shown that measures of systemic markers of inflammation and lipid or glucose metabolism (P < 0.001) were increased with higher WHR. When adjusted for age, sex, smoking, diabetes, education, physical activity, and last dentist's appointment, C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and leukocyte count were significantly related to WHR increasing from the first to the fourth WHR quartile (P < 0.001) as well as to the BMI. In both dentate and edentulous subjects higher WHR contributes significantly to increasing systemic CRP and fibrinogen with sex differences. In toothless subjects, while still dependent on increasing WHR, the inflammatory markers CRP and fibrinogen were higher than in dentate subjects, thereby revealing effect modification between sex and edentulism (P < 0.010). In conclusion, subjects with total tooth loss, although devoid of periodontal inflammation, may exhibit increased levels of systemic inflammatory mediators. Possible implications are discussed with respect to obesity and its relationship to inflammation.",0
"The aim of this project was to investigate edentulism and dental caries in nursing home residents in Victoria, Australia.
The Australian population is ageing with a growing number of people living in nursing homes. These residents are at increased risk for dental caries, have more teeth present now than at any time in the past 50 years and often have difficulty maintaining adequate oral hygiene.
Clinical dental examinations were conducted at 31 nursing homes in Melbourne and regional Victoria between May 2005 and June 2006. A total of 510 residents were examined out of 1345 eligible participants. Socio-demographic and medical history was collected via questionnaire.
Just over half of the residents were dentate (53.9%), and dentate residents had a mean of 14.4 teeth present and 2.66 untreated decayed teeth. Residents who required total assistance with oral hygiene had more decayed teeth and fewer filled teeth than residents who did not require assistance.
Nursing home residents in Victoria are retaining an increasing number of natural teeth and have more tooth surfaces at risk for dental caries. Untreated dental caries was a significant problem for residents, particularly for those who are dependent on others for their daily oral hygiene care.",0
"The aim of this study was to investigate radiographically the prevalence of apical periodontitis (AP) and endodontic treatment in a sample of adult type II diabetic patients and control subjects.
In a cross-sectional study, the radiographic records of 50 adult patients reporting a history of well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) (study group) and 50 age- and sex-matched subjects who reported no history of DM (control group) were examined. Periapical status of all teeth was assessed using the periapical index score.
The average number of teeth per patient in the diabetic and control groups was 21.9 and 24.6 teeth, respectively (P = .012). AP in one or more teeth was found in 37 diabetic patients (74%) and in 21 control subjects (42%) (odds ratio = 3.9, P = .002). One or more root-filled teeth were found in 35 (70%) and 25 (50%) of diabetic and control subjects, respectively (odds ratio = 2.3, P = .043). Among diabetic patients with root-filled teeth, 16 (46%) had AP affecting at least one treated tooth. Among controls with root-filled teeth, 6 (24%) had AP affecting at least one treated tooth (P > .05). Adjusting for teeth number, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that periapical status (odds ratio = 3.3, P = .0071) and the number of root-filled teeth (odds ratio = 1.7; P = .0035) were significantly associated with diabetic status.
The results showed that in adult patients, type 2 DM is significantly associated with an increased prevalence of AP and endodontic treatment.",0
"Our objective was to compare survival and peri-implant bone levels of immediately nonocclusally vs early loaded implants in partially edentulous patients up to 12 months after implant placement. Eighty patients (inclusion criteria: general good health, good oral hygiene, 30-65 years old; exclusion criteria: head and neck irradiation/cancer, pregnancy, uncontrolled diabetes, substance abuse, bruxism, lack of opposing occluding dentition, smokers >10 cigarettes/day, need for bone augmentation procedures) were selected in 5 Italian study centers and randomized into 2 groups: 40 patients in the immediately loaded group (minimal insertion torque 30 Ncm) and 40 patients in the early loaded group. Immediately loaded implants were provided with nonoccluding temporary restorations. Final restorations were provided 2 months later. Early loaded implants were provided with a definitive restoration after 2 months. Peri-implant bone resorption was evaluated radiographically with software (ImageJ 1.42). No dropout occurred. Both groups gradually lost peri-implant bone. After 12 months, patients of both groups lost an average of 0.4 mm of peri-implant bone. There were no statistically significant differences (evaluated with t test) between the 2 loading strategies for peri-implant bone level changes at 2 (P = .6730), 6 (P = .6613) and 12 (P = .5957) months or for survival rates (100% in both groups). If adequate primary stability is achieved, immediate loading of dental implants can provide similar success rates, survival rates, and peri-implant bone resorption as compared with early loading, as evaluated in the present study.",0
"It is not clear if the interaction of craniofacial form with type of prosthetic restoration (conventional or implant-assisted) is related to masticatory function in complete denture patients.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships among facial form, skeletal class, alveolar residual ridge heights and masticatory function in subjects treated with implant-assisted or conventional mandibular dentures with lateral cephalometric evaluation.
Data from a previously reported randomized controlled clinical trial were accessed to compare treatment success rates, functional and perceptual outcomes, dietary intake, and craniofacial relationships between mandibular complete dentures and implant overdentures in edentulous diabetic subjects. Evaluation of the digitized post-insertion lateral cephalometric radiographs provided measures of facial form (mesocephalic ""medium"", brachycephalic ""broad and square"", dolichocephalic ""vertical and long""), skeletal class (Class I, Class II, Class III), and alveolar ridge height (mm), which were compared to results of standardized masticatory tests as evaluated using MANOVA and REGW post-hoc evaluation (α=.05).
Masticatory performance on the preferred side was slightly reduced in the dolichocephalic group, compared to brachycephalic and mesocephalic groups (P=.085). Swallowing threshold performance was significantly less in skeletal Class II subjects compared to Class I (P=.034). Maxillary residual alveolar ridge height was significantly less in the brachycephalic group compared to the dolichocephalic group (P<.001). No differences in mandibular ridge height were seen associated with facial form or skeletal class groups.
Facial form may be related to masticatory function with conventional and implant-assisted mandibular dentures, but larger controlled studies are needed to confirm this relationship. Alveolar ridge height is reduced in edentulous subjects with a brachycephalic facial form.",0
"The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of edentulism in Mexican elders aged 60 years and older, and the associated risk indicators. A cross-sectional study was undertaken in 139 elders living in either of two long-term care (LTC) facilities, or attending an adult day center (ADC) in Pachuca, Mexico. A subject was edentulous when natural teeth were completely absent, determined through a clinical examination. Risk indicators were collected using questionnaires. Analyses were performed using binary logistic regression in STATA 9.0. Mean age was 79.0±9.8 years. Many subjects were women (69.1%). The prevalence of edentulism was 36.7%. In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for age and sex, the variables that were inversely associated (p<0.05) with edentulism were living with a spouse (odds ratio=OR=0.31), and lacking health insurance (OR=0.70). Variables associated with higher risk of being edentate were lower educational attainment (OR=1.61), having received radiation therapy (OR=4.49), being a smoker (OR=4.82), and having diabetes (OR=2.94) or other chronic illnesses (OR=1.82) (with hypertension approaching significance, p=0.067). In this sample of Mexican elders, diverse variables were associated with edentulism, in particular smoking and past radiotherapy. Oral health programs within and outside LTC/ADC should take into account risk factors specific to the older population.",0
"Periodontal disease is a serious oral health problem that is observed in patients with diabetes mellitus. The aim of the present study is to observe the oral health condition in a diabetic type 2 population in connection with glycaemic control and lifestyle.
A questionnaire was distributed to 118 patients in a centre for diabetics to collect information, such as date of birth, year of onset of diabetes, diabetic parameters, pharmacological therapy and oral hygiene habits. An oral examination was conducted to evaluate the presence of plaque, calculus, tooth mobility, caries and gingivitis. In a sub-group scaling and root planning (SRP) was completed.
Thirty-one of 118 patients were edentulous and were excluded from the main analysis. Nearly 60% of patients presented dental plaque and gingivitis. A statistically significant difference in patients with or without a glycaemic control was only observed in women. Patients treated with SRP had significant better oral health and a slight reduction of HbA1c.
Poor oral health care was observed in the diabetic population. The high risk of periodontal disease needs the attention of dental hygienist.",0
"To investigate the role of periodontal infection in obesity in an adult population.
This study was based on a subpopulation of the Health 2000 Survey that included dentate, non-diabetic subjects, aged 30-49 years (n=2784). Obesity was measured using the body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (BF%) and waist circumference (WC). The extent of periodontal infection was measured using the number of teeth with deepened (4 mm deep or deeper) periodontal pockets and was categorized into four categories (0, 1-3, 4-6, 7 or more).
The number of teeth with deepened periodontal pockets was found to be associated with BMI in an exposure-response manner among the total study population. The association was found among men and women, and also among never-smokers. The number of teeth with deepened periodontal pockets was also associated with BF% and WC among never-smokers.
Periodontal infection measured by means of the number of teeth with deepened periodontal pockets appears to be associated with obesity. However, no inferences about causality can be made and further studies are needed to clarify the possible role of periodontal infection in obesity.",0
"Periodontal disease is associated with diabetes, heart disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD), relationships postulated to be due in part to vascular inflammation. A bidirectional relationship between CKD and periodontal disease is plausible, though this relationship has not been previously reported. In this study, we assessed the potential for connections between CKD and periodontal disease, and mediators of these relationships using structural equation models of data from 11,211 adults ≥ 18 years of age who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to test the hypothesis that periodontal disease was independently associated with CKD. Given the potential that the periodontal disease and CKD relationship may be bidirectional, a two-step analytic approach was used that involved tests for mediation and structural equation models to examine more complex direct and indirect effects of periodontal disease on CKD, and vice versa. In two separate models, periodontal disease (adjusted odds ratio of 1.62), edentulism (adjusted odds ratio of 1.83), and the periodontal disease score were associated with CKD when simultaneously adjusting for 14 other factors. Altogether, three of four structural equation models support the hypothesized relationship. Thus, our analyses support a bidirectional relationship between CKD and periodontal disease, mediated by hypertension and the duration of diabetes.",0
"To describe the clinical appearance of Candida-associated denture stomatitis (DS) in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The relationships between the types of DS, oral complaints and associated conditions were assessed in terms of glycemic control as determined by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurements.
Demographic and clinical data were obtained from questionnaires and oral examinations of 110 edentulous patients with T2DM and 50 control subjects.
Type II DS commonly occurred in diabetics (57.3% vs 30%; p=0.002) together with DS related oral complaints (60.9% vs 24%; p<0.001) compared with controls. Burning sensation of the mouth (BS) was the most common complaint. Dryness of the oral mucosa (DOM) (50.9% vs 6%; p<0.001), angular cheilitis (26.4% vs 8%; p=0.01) and glossitis (27.3% vs 6%; p=0.003) occurred more frequently in diabetics. Oral complaints and associated conditions of DS coincided with elevated HbA1c levels (p<0.001). Diabetics with extensive type of inflammation had higher HbA1c levels than type I/III DS subjects (p<0.001).
Diffuse type of inflammation was associated with T2DM. BS and DOM were the most common oral complaints. Inadequately controlled diabetes with Candida-associated DS was linked to a high incidence of an extensive type of inflammation, oral complaints and associated conditions.",0
"Diabetic neuropathy (DN) has been associated with oral dryness, tooth loss and an increased risk for foot ulceration, but the association between periodontal problems and DN has not been fully elucidated. This study investigated whether the risk for neuropathic foot ulceration (DM-NFUR) was associated with periodontal disease (PD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
This cross-sectional study examined 122 patients with type 2 diabetes for PD; findings were compared with results for presence of DM-NFUR. PD severity was classified as none/mild (NM-PD), moderate/severe (MS-PD) and edentulous (E).
NM-PD was found in 40.2% patients; MS-PD, in 32.0%; and 27.8% were edentulous. DM-NFUR was detected in 18.4% of the patients in the NM-PD group, in 68.2% in the MS-PD group, and in 61.8% of completely edentulous individuals. PD was significantly correlated with DM-NFUR (p<or=0.001). After adjustment for sex, age, diabetes duration, dental health care and education, PD and edentulism were independently associated with DM-NFUR (odds ratio(adjusted); 6.6; 95% CI 2.3-18.8; p<or=0.001, and odds ratio(adjusted) 4.9; 95% CI 1.6-15.3; p<or=0.01).
Patients with DM-NFUR have substantially more MS-PD and edentulism. Further studies should evaluate whether diabetic neuropathy is a risk factor for PD.",0
"The objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of xerostomia (dry mouth sensation) and hyposalivation in elderly type-2 diabetic individuals and to establish whether such conditions might be associated with their socioeconomic status and/or medical and oral health conditions.
The present cross-sectional study included 315 functionally independent elderly individuals, aged 60 years or above, residing in Natal, northeastern Brazil. A total of 52 subjects self-reported to be diabetic. The data on the subjects' health condition were collected using a questionnaire, performing a physical examination and sialometry (unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva flow rates), and the variables were subjected to descriptive statistics, chi-square and Student t test (a = 0.05).
The prevalence of dry mouth was found to be 25%. Hyposalivation was found in 48% and 46% of the subjects in unstimulated and stimulated conditions, respectively. The only factor that was associated with xerostomia among the diabetics was workplace (P = 0.01), suggesting that elderly diabetics working at home might be less likely to have dry mouth than those working outside. No variable assessed was associated with hyposalivation, in either unstimulated or stimulated salivary flow.
The prevalence of dry mouth and hyposalivation was high in elderly diabetics. Only at-home jobs were observed to be associated with dry mouth. There was no association between hyposalivation and the variables assessed, with regard to either unstimulated or stimulated saliva. Further studies, involving larger samples, are required to confirm the present findings.",0
"Complete edentulism is the terminal outcome of a multifactorial process involving biological factors and patient-related factors. It continues to represent a tremendous global health care burden, and will for the foreseeable future. The purpose of this review is to determine what comorbid factors exist for the completely edentulous patient.
This literature review evaluated articles obtained via the National Library of Medicine's PubMed website, using keywords of edentulism with various combinations of the terms comorbidity, incidence, health, nutrition, cancer, cardiovascular health, diabetes, osteoporosis, smoking, asthma, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis. Abstracts were selected and screened, and selected full-text articles were reviewed. Articles were limited to those with adequate patient cohorts and a minimum of 2-year follow-up data.
Edentulism was found to be a global issue, with estimates for an increasing demand for complete denture prostheses in the future. Completely edentulous patients were found to be at higher risk for poor nutrition, coronary artery plaque formation (odds ratio 2.32), to be smokers (odds ratio 2.42), to be asthmatic and edentulous in the maxillary arch (odds ratio 10.52), to being diabetic (odds ratio 1.82), to having rheumatoid arthritis (odds ratio 2.27), and to having certain cancers (odds ratios varying from 1.54 to 2.85, depending on the type of cancer). Chronic residual ridge resorption continues to be the primary intraoral complication of edentulation, and there appear to be few opportunities to reduce bone loss in the edentulous patient.
While the completely edentulous patient seems to be at risk for multiple systemic disorders, whether development of these disorders is causal or casual has not been determined. To minimize the loss of residual alveolar ridges, exemplary complete denture therapy, along with the establishment of routine recall systems, should be the ultimate goal of treatment of this patient cohort.",0
"The subjects in this retrospective case series were derived from a review of 700 patient files within the implant practice of the Department of Periodontology, University Hospital, Catholic University of Leuven. Inclusion criteria were met by 412 patients (240 females, 172 males) receiving a total of 1514 Nobel Biocare dental implants. These patients were included based on data availability for the time period 2 years after abutment surgery (considered to represent late implant failure).
Given the concern of the authors to assess the probability of late implant failure among clinic patients with certain local and systemic factors, the potential factors were multiple. The local factors included the following: implant length and diameter, bone quality and quantity, insertion site, type of edentulism, antibiotic use perioperatively, dehiscence and/or perforation of the site during surgery, and stability at insertion (measured by Periotest values). The related health and behavioral factors included the following: medications, smoking (<10 cigarettes/day, 10-20 cigarettes/ day, >20 cigarettes/day), hypertension, ischemic cardiac problems, coagulation anomalies, gastric ulcers, thyroid disorders, hypercholesterolemia,rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, diabetes (types 1 and 2), Crohn's disease, and chemotherapy.
The primary outcome was described as ""late implant failure."" The current study, which follows a similar study on early implant failure, aims to identify negative influences on maintenance of integration. The authors used the clinical experience related to the 412 patients with 1514 implants to identify whether the observed failure rates were influenced by local and systemic factors. Failure was defined as ""late"" when occurring between abutment connection surgery and 2 years after this date. Patients/implants that were not available for this interval of time were not included. However, even when records were available, not all patient records provided all data sought.
Regarding local factors, the authors reported that implant diameter and location were relevant to late implant loss, whereas implant length was not (P value = .01, = .34, respectively; univariate generalized estimating equation [GEE] logistic regression). Regarding implant diameter, significantly more loss was noted for 5.00-mm implants when compared with the 4.00-mm or 4.75-mm implants. Failure related to location revealed that the maxilla compared with the mandible, posterior jaws compared with anterior jaws, and the posterior maxilla compared with all other oral locations were associated with more late failures (Table 1). Assessment of systemic factors revealed radiotherapy to be related to more late implant loss (P = .003). Neither systemic disease nor smoking exposure was associated with late failure.
The authors concluded that late implant failure was influenced by the local factor ""implant location"" and the systemic factor ""radiotherapy."" Neither smoking nor systemic health factors were found to adversely influence implant integration from abutment connection through 2 years' performance.",0
"Infection may be a type 2 diabetes risk factor. Periodontal disease is a chronic infection. We hypothesized that periodontal disease was related to A1C progression in diabetes-free participants.
The Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) is a population-based cohort in Germany including 2,973 diabetes-free participants (53% women; aged 20-81 years). Participants were categorized into four groups according to increasing baseline periodontal disease levels (percentage of sites per mouth with attachment loss >or=5 mm, determined a priori); sample sizes for each respective category were 1,122, 488, 463, and 479 (241 participants were edentulous). Mean absolute changes (year 5 minus baseline) in A1C (DeltaA1C) were regressed across periodontal categories while adjusting for confounders (e.g., age, sex, smoking, obesity, physical activity, and family history).
Across baseline periodontal disease categories, DeltaA1C +/- SEM values were 0.023 +/- 0.02, 0.023 +/- 0.02, 0.065 +/- 0.03, and 0.106 +/- 0.03 (P(trend) = 0.02), yielding an approximate fivefold increase in the absolute difference in DeltaA1C when dentate participants in the highest versus lowest periodontal disease category were compared; these results were markedly stronger among participants with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein >or=1.0 mg/l (P(interaction) = 0.01). When individuals who had neither baseline periodontal disease nor deterioration in periodontal status at 5 years were compared with individuals with both poor baseline periodontal health and longitudinal periodontal deterioration, mean DeltaA1C values were 0.005 vs. 0.143% (P = 0.003).
Periodontal disease was associated with 5-year A1C progression, which was similar to that observed for a 2-SD increase in either waist-to-hip ratio or age in this population.",0
"To analyze the predictive ability of a functional cognitive index of mortality in the elderly.
Cohort study performed with 1,667 elderly individuals aged more than 65 years and living in the city of São Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, between 1991 and 2001. Functional cognitive index was constructed from time orientation and executive functions (going shopping and taking medication), controlled by sociodemographic variables, life habits, morbidity, self-perception of health, hospitalization, edentulism and social support. Deaths occurred during this period were analyzed with family members in home interviews, notary public offices and records from the Fundação Seade (State System of Data Analysis Foundation), until 2003. Crude and adjusted relative risks were calculated with their respective 95% confidence intervals, using bivariate and multiple analysis with Poisson regression and p<0.05.
In the final multivariate model, the following independent risk factors were identified by the index: partial loss of time orientation or executive functions (RR=1.37; 95% CI: 1.03;1.83); total loss of orientation and partial loss of functions (RR=1.71; 95% CI: 1.24;2.37); partial loss of orientation and total loss of functions (RR=1.76; 95% CI: 1.35;2.28); and total loss of orientation and functions (RR=1.64; 95% CI: 1.30;2.06). As regards health conditions, the following were observed: hospitalization (RR=1.45; 95% CI: 1.22;1.73); diabetes (RR=1.20; 95% CI: 1.00;1.44); and total edentulism (RR=1.34; 95% CI: 1.09;1.66). Monthly contact with relatives was identified as a protective factor (RR=0.83; 95% CI: 0.69;1.00).
The Functional Cognitive Index can help clinicians and health planners to make decisions on strategies for follow-up and prevention of treatable causes of cognitive deficit and functional loss to reduce mortality in the elderly.",0
"To clarify the association of tooth loss with dietary intakes among dentists, for whom sufficient dental care is available.
We analyzed the data from 20 366 Japanese dentists (mean age +/- SD, 52.2 +/- 12.1 years; women 8.0%) who participated in a nationwide cohort study from 2001 to 2006. The baseline questionnaire included a validated food-frequency questionnaire to estimate intakes of foods and nutrients. We computed the geometric means of daily intakes by the number of teeth, adjusting for age, sex, smoking, physical activity, and history of diabetes.
The mean intakes of some key nutrients and food groups, such as carotene, vitamins A and C, milk and dairy products, and vegetables including green-yellow vegetables, decreased with the increasing number of teeth lost (P for trend <0.05). On the contrary, mean intakes of carbohydrate, rice, and confectioneries were increased among those with fewer teeth (P for trend <0.05). The difference in the geometric mean (%) between totally edentulous subjects and those with > or =25 teeth, that is [(Geometric mean for > or =25 teeth) - (Geometric mean for 0 teeth)]/(Geometric mean for > or =25 teeth) x 100, was 14.3%, 8.6%, 6.1%, and -6.1% for carotene, vitamin C, vitamin A, and carbohydrate, respectively. For food groups, it was 26.3%, 11.9%, 5.6%, -9.5%, and -29.6% for milk and dairy products, green-yellow vegetables, total vegetables, rice, and confectioneries, respectively.
Tooth loss was linked with poorer nutrition even among dentists.",0
"To produce evidence on an association between the number of teeth and selected cardiovascular risk factors among an elderly population.
The study population comprised of 523 community-living elderly people who participated in the population-based Kuopio 75+ study. The data for each subject were collected using a structured clinical health examination, an interview and laboratory tests. Linear regression models were used to estimate adjusted mean values and confidence limits.
Edentulous persons and persons with a small number of teeth had lower serum HDL cholesterol and higher triglyceride, leucocyte and blood glucose levels and a higher body mass index (BMI) compared with subjects to a large number of teeth.
The study showed that, in the Finnish home-dwelling population aged 75 years or older, those with a large number of teeth were less likely to have cardiovascular risk factors such as a low serum HDL cholesterol level, a high triglyceride level and a high BMI than did subjects with a small number of teeth or who were edentulous.",0
"Results from numerous studies have suggested links between periodontal disease and coronary heart disease (CHD), but endodontic disease has not been studied extensively in this regard.
The authors evaluated the relationship between self-reported history of endodontic therapy (ET) and prevalent CHD in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, aprospective epidemiologic study sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The authors used multivariable logistic regressionto analyze data obtained from oral health questionnaires, medical evaluations and clinical dental examinations.
Of 6,651 participants analyzed, 50.4 percent reported never having had ET; 21.5 percent reported having had ET one time; and 28.0 percent reported having had ET two or more times. Final multivariable regression models indicated that among participants with 25 or more teeth, those reporting having had ET two or more times had 1.62 (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.53) times the odds of prevalent CHD compared with those reporting never having had ET. Among participants with 24 or fewer teeth, no significant differences in CHD prevalence were observed among groups regardless of their history of ET.
Among participants with 25 or more teeth, those with a greater self-reported history of ET were more likely to have CHD than were those reporting no history of ET.
More accurate epidemiologic quantification of endodontic infection and inflammation is required before definitive conclusions can be made about potential relationships between endodontic disease and CHD.",0
"The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence, extent, and risk indicators of tooth loss in an isolated population of Brazil.
Two-hundred-and-forty-two subjects, ranging in age from 14 to 82 years (mean 36.2 years), were identified by census in an isolated population of Brazil. All consenting subjects received a full-mouth clinical (DFT index and information about missing teeth) and periodontal examination of 6 sites per tooth. Furthermore, they were interviewed using a structured written questionnaire in order to gather information about demographic, environmental, and biological variables.
Of the 200 subjects (80% response rate), 19 (9.5%) were edentulous, 90% had lost at least one tooth, and 39% had lost more than 8 teeth. The mean number of teeth lost was 9.5 (95% CI = 8.2-10.8). First mandibular molars were the most commonly missing teeth. In a multiple logistic regression analysis based on a theoretical hierarchical model of tooth loss, having more than 8 teeth lost was strongly associated with adult age (OR = 18.3-17.3, 95% CIs = 4.8-69.7 and 4.0-75.1) and female gender (OR = 5.9, 95% CI = 1.9-18.2) in the final model.
Tooth loss was highly prevalent and extensive in this isolated population. Demographic and behavioral factors played an important role in tooth loss prevalence in this population.",0
"Oral candidiasis is a common opportunistic infection in diabetic patients. Presence of denture in the oral cavity of diabetic patients can promote Candida colonization and results in the higher incidence of oral and systemic candidiasis. The general purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare Candida colonization in denture of diabetic patients and non-diabetic control group.
In current case-control study, samples for mycological examinations were collected from the palatal impression surface of maxillary dentures from 92 edentulous patients including 46 dia-betic and 46 non-diabetic denture wearers. All samples were cultured directly on sabouraud agar me-dium and isolated colonies were counted and identified based on specific tests. Data were statistically analyzed using Mann-Whitney and Spearman correlation tests.
The higher density of isolated colonies was seen in diabetic group in compare with control group (P = 0.0001). There was a statistically significant correlation between the blood glucose level (P = 0.0001) and the duration of denture usage (P = 0.022) with the colonization of Candida on denture of diabetic patients. C. albicans was the most common isolated Candida species in both groups, though diabetic patients with dentures had more non-albicans Candida isolated from their dentures compared to non-diabetic patients.
Mycological findings from the present study revealed that diabetes mellitus can in-crease colonization of Candida in denture and mouth. By elimination of local and systemic factors in diabetic patients and improving their oral health care, Candida colonization and the risk of oral and systemic candidiasis will be decreased.",0

"Faulty complete denture can lead to deleterious effects on residual ridges. These deleterious effects are further severed if patient is systematically compromised as in Diabetes mellitus. Decreased resistance to infection, vascular changes, and altered tissue response seen in uncontrolled Diabetes when coupled with faulty denture prosthesis can even lead to gangrenous necrosis.Prosthodontic management of edentulous patient with maxillary defect is a challenging task because there is reduced denture bearing surface compromising adhesion, cohesion and peripheral seal thus affecting retention adversely; reduced support area for denture; air leakage due to poor stability; retentive deficiencies and movement of prosthesis during function. Prosthetic rehabilitation for these patients can be accomplished with minor modifications in procedures like incremental shaping technique for taking impression, modifications in jaw relation, tooth arrangement, and fabrication of hollow bulb obturator along with atraumatic and meticulous care during all the procedures.This clinical report describes a case of gangrenous necrosis of premaxilla caused due to a faulty previous prosthesis; and its prosthodontic management.",0
"An estimated 75% of the seven million Americans with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease are undiagnosed. Improved prediction models to identify high-risk subgroups for chronic kidney disease enhance the ability of health care providers to prevent or delay serious sequelae, including kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and premature death.
We identified 11,955 adults > or =18 years of age in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Chronic kidney disease was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15 to 59 ml/minute/1.73 m(2). High-risk subgroups for chronic kidney disease were identified by estimating the individual probability using beta coefficients from the model of traditional and non-traditional risk factors. To evaluate this model, we performed standard diagnostic analyses of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value using 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% probability cutoff points.
The estimated probability of chronic kidney disease ranged from virtually no probability (0%) for an individual with none of the 12 risk factors to very high probability (98%) for an older, non-Hispanic white edentulous former smoker, with diabetes > or =10 years, hypertension, macroalbuminuria, high cholesterol, low high-density lipoprotein, high C-reactive protein, lower income, and who was hospitalized in the past year. Evaluation of this model using an estimated 5% probability cutoff point resulted in 86% sensitivity, 85% specificity, 18% positive predictive value, and 99% negative predictive value.
This United States population-based study suggested the importance of considering multiple risk factors, including periodontal status, because this improves the identification of individuals at high risk for chronic kidney disease and may ultimately reduce its burden.",0
"The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of peri-implant diseases around Branemark system implants in Brazilians and the possible relationship with periodontal bone loss, systemic condition, and demographic profile. A total of 113 individuals were enrolled in this study, and they received 347 implants. The implants were clinically and radiographically examined and diagnosed as healthy implants, mucositis, or peri-implantitis. The demographic and systemic profiles of the individuals were assessed via questionnaires, and the time of loading was obtained from files. The presence of periodontal bone loss in partially edentulous patients was determined by standardized radiographic evaluation. With regard to implants, the prevalence was 60.5% (n = 210), 32% (n = 111), and 7.5% (n = 26) for healthy tissues, mucositis, and peri-implantitis, respectively. No correlation was found between peri-implant tissue conditions and socioeconomic status, body mass index, smoking status, gender, age, diabetes mellitus, osteopenia, and osteoporosis. Statistically significant positive correlations were found in implants with mucositis and peri-implantitis in relation to time of loading and with peri-implantitis in relation to periodontal bone loss in the 4 quadrants (P < .05). Presence of peri-implant diseases may be associated with the increasing time of loading and generalized periodontal bone loss.",0
"To investigate the effect of type-2 diabetes on implant survival and complication rate.
Prospective study enrolling type-2 diabetic patients suffering from edentulism, having a mean perioperative HbA1c level of 7.2%, and compliant with a maintenance program. All the patients underwent dental and periodontal examinations and had laboratory testing for HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, blood lipids, and microalbuminuria. Nondiabetic patients matched for implant treatment indication served as controls. The influence of clinical diabetes-related factors and periodontal parameters (Plaque Index, bleeding on probing, probing depth) on implant survival were assessed via univariate then multivariate methods.
Forty-five diabetic patients, followed for 1 to 12 years, mean age 64.7 years, received 255 implants: 143 following a classical protocol and 112 in cases of sinus floor elevation, immediate loading, and guided bone regeneration. Forty-five nondiabetic control patients received 244 implants: 142 following a classical protocol and 102 in cases of advanced surgery. Implant survival following conventional or advanced implant therapy was not statistically different between the well-controlled (HbA1c < 7%, P = .33) and the fairly well-controlled group (HbA1c 7% to 9%, P = .37). The overall survival rate for the diabetic group was 97.2% (control 98.8%) and was not significantly different for age, gender, diabetes duration, smoking, or type of hypoglycemic therapy. The mean peri-implant bone loss was 0.41 +/- 0.58 mm (control, 0.49 +/- 0.64 mm). PI and BOP fairly correlated with postoperative complications. HbA1c was the only multivariate independent factor affecting the complication rate (P = .04). No statistically significant difference was found for patients (P = .81) or for implants (P = .66) for the advanced surgery cases or the conventional approach in diabetic patients compared to nondiabetic patients.",0
"Chronic kidney disease and its concomitant sequelae represent a major public health problem. Recent data suggest periodontal infection contributes to chronic kidney disease.
This United States population-based study of 4,053 adults > or =40 years of age investigated the association between chronic kidney disease and clinical measures and serologic markers of periodontal infection. Chronic kidney disease was defined as moderate-to-severe reduction of kidney function with glomerular filtration rate of 15 to 59 ml/minute/1.73 m(2) based on stages 3 and 4 of the Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative. Chronic oral inflammatory burden was measured as 1) clinical periodontal infection categorized as no periodontal disease, periodontal disease (at least one tooth with > or =4 mm loss of attachment and bleeding on probing as an indicator of inflammation), or edentulism and 2) serum immunoglobulin G antibody response to Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Multiple logistic regression modeling quantified the association between chronic kidney disease and chronic inflammatory burden and other risk factors.
Nine percent of the study population had chronic kidney disease, 22% had high A. actinomycetemcomitans antibody titer, 24% had high P. gingivalis antibody titer, 9% had periodontal disease, and 17% were edentulous. After simultaneously adjusting for recognized risk factors, adults with a high A. actinomycetemcomitans titer were less likely to have chronic kidney disease (adjusted odds ratio [OR(Adj)] = 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46 to 0.98), and adults with edentulism were more likely to have chronic kidney disease (OR(Adj) = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.11 to 2.44).
These results support considering edentulism and low serum titer to A. actinomycetemcomitans as risk indicators for chronic kidney disease.",0
"The present study is to investigate the effects of type 1 diabetes mellitus on dentition and oral health for children and adolescents.
The investigation was carried out on 100 subjects. The first group consisted of 50 subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus (21 females, 29 males), age 9+/-0.14 years; In the second group, there were 50 healthy subjects who did not suffer from any systemic disease (25 females, 25 males), age 9+/-0.11 years. The subjects were evaluated and divided into two groups of 5-9 years old, and 10-14 years old. The dentition of all participants was examined. Besides, the DFS/dfs index, oral hygiene conditions were evaluated, as well as the plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI) and calculus index (CI). The data obtained from each group were compared statistically.
When compared to the non-diabetic group, we observed that dental development was accelerated until the age of 10 in the diabetic group, and there was a delay after the age of 10. The edentulous interval was longer in the group with type 1 diabetes mellitus. This was accompanied by a high ratio of gingival inflammation. Gingival inflammation was 69.7% in the group of 5-9 year-old, and 83.7% in the group of 10-14 year-old with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Though there was a greater loss of teeth in the group with type 1 diabetes mellitus, there were more caries in the control group. The PI, GI and CI values showed an increase with aging in favor of the group with type 1 diabetes mellitus. There was statistically significant difference in PI, GI and CI between the control and type 1 diabetes mellitus groups for 10-14 year-old patients (p<0.001).
The findings we obtained showed that type 1 diabetes mellitus plays an important part in the dentition and oral health of children and adolescents.",0
"Tooth loss and edentulism are important negative health outcomes; however, there is little current information about the prevalence of these conditions among adults in New Zealand (NZ). This study describes the dentate status of Maori and non-Maori NZ women with regard to tooth loss, edentulism and denture-wearing, and investigates ethnic and sociodemographic disparities within the sample. Associations between dentate status, socio-demographic and health-related factors are described.
Participants were 1,817 women who were screened for participation in a randomised controlled trial.
9.0% of women were edentulous and 30.3% wore a denture (partial or complete). The mean number of teeth present was 24.2, and older women had fewer teeth on average. Socio-demographic and ethnic disparities in tooth loss and edentulism were observed. Maori ethnicity was strongly associated with edentulism and tooth loss, with Maori women five times more likely than NZ European women to be edentulous. These associations held after controlling for age, education, smoking, diabetes, cardiovascular disease history, and BMI.
Marked ethnic disparities in edentulism and tooth loss exist in New Zealand. Effective targeted programmes are needed to reduce the public health impact of poor oral health among Maori.",0
"To examine if number of remaining teeth was associated with development of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over 5-12 years.
Prospective observational study among 1474 men and 1458 women born 1922, 1932, 1942 or 1952 from The Danish MONICA follow up study (MONItoring trends in and determinants of CArdiovascular disease) in 1987-88 and 1993-94. Subjects were followed in Danish registers for fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease or stroke.
Tooth loss was strongly associated with incidence of stroke, and to a lesser extent, incidence of cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease, during averagely 7.5 years of follow-up. Compared to those with most teeth remaining, the edentulous suffered >3-fold increased Hazard (HR) of developing stroke (HR=3.25; 95% CI: 1.48-7.14), whereas the risk of developing any cardiovascular disease was increased by 50% (HR=1.50; 95% CI: 1.02-2.19). Risk for coronary heart disease was increased by 31%, but was not significant, after the adjustment for education, age, smoking, diabetes, alcohol intake, systolic blood pressure and body mass index (HR= 1.31; 95% CI: 0.74-2.31). Associations were similar for men and women.
These findings may have implications for future prevention of cardiovascular disease in general, and of stroke in particular, because tooth loss may serve as a simple, and early means to identify high-risk individuals.",0
"This retrospective study was set to assess the influence of systemic and local bone and intra-oral factors on the occurrence of implant loss from abutment connection up to 2 years.
The files of 700 patients, have been collected randomly from the total patient group treated by means of endosseous Brånemark system implants (Nobel Biocare, Gothenburg, Sweden) at the Department of Periodontology of the University Hospital of the Catholic University of Leuven. The end point observation was evaluating the loss of the implants 2 years after abutment installation. The study involved all implants that did not encounter early loss and implants for which it was possible to evaluate its status 2 years after abutment surgery. Thus, data of 412 patients (240 females) provided with 1514 implants were analyzed. For each patient, the medical history was carefully checked. Data collection and analysis were mainly focused on endogenous factors such as hypertension, coagulation problems, osteoporosis, hypo- hyperthyroidism, chemotherapy, diabetes type I or II, Crohn's disease, some local factors [e.g. bone quality and quantity, implant (length, diameter, location), type of edentulism, PTV, radiotherapy], smoking habits, and breach of sterility during surgery.
Radiotherapy, implant (diameter and location), and higher PTV at implant insertion and abutment connection, all affected significantly the implant loss.
Implant location in the oral cavity and radiotherapy seem predominant to explain the occurrence of implant loss. On the other hand, smoking and systemic health factors do not seem to be prominent players in the etiology of late implant loss.",0
"The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of malnutrition, and its associated risk factors, in stroke patients residing in an infirmary in Hong Kong.
A cross-sectional retrospective study of 61 stroke patients residing in an infirmary was conducted. Baseline demographic data, including age, gender, smoking habit, and alcohol consumption, were obtained on admission. Nutritional status was assessed according to anthropometric parameters. Malnutrition was defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of below 18.5 kg per square metres for both gender and a serum albumin level of less than 35 g/L. 12 risk factors associated with malnutrition were evaluated according to established protocols.
61 of the 93 patients assessed had a history of cardiovascular accident and gave consent to participate in the study. Among them were 28 (46 percent) women and 33 (54 percent) men. The mean length of stay of these patients was 850 days (or 28 months). The mean age of these patients was 76 (standard deviation 12.8) years. Among the patients, five (8.2 percent) were malnourished and 56 (91.8 percent) were adequately nourished. There were no significant differences in the distribution of eight risk factors between the malnourished and nourished groups. These risk factors were a previous history of alcohol consumption, comorbidities (five or more), polypharmacy (five or more), diabetes mellitus, impaired functional status of daily living, impaired mobility (wheelchair- or bed-bound), tube-feeding, and edentulism. Insufficient data was available to assess the effects of two risk factors: depressed mood and impaired cognitive function. The distribution of another two risks factors (previous history of smoking and dysphagia) was significantly different between the malnourished and nourished groups. Odds ratios of smoking and dysphagia associated with malnourishment were approximately 3.3 and 2.6, respectively.
Five of 61 (8.2 percent) stroke patients residing in an infirmary were malnourished. Two risk factors significantly associated with malnutrition were previous history of smoking and dysphagia. It is recommended that smoking history be elicited during routine history-taking of all stroke patients and particular nutritional attention be given to these at-risk patients. It is also emphasised that the management of dysphagia should follow a standardised protocol and form an integral element of patient care.",0
"Type 2 diabetes and periodontal disease are known to be associated, but the temporality of this relationship has not been firmly established. We investigated whether baseline periodontal disease independently predicts incident diabetes over two decades of follow-up.
A total of 9,296 nondiabetic male and female National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) participants aged 25-74 years who completed a baseline dental examination (1971-1976) and had at least one follow-up evaluation (1982-1992) were studied. We defined six categories of baseline periodontal disease using the periodontal index. Of 7,168 dentate participants, 47% had periodontal index = 0 (periodontally healthy); the remaining were classified into periodontal index quintiles. Incident diabetes was defined by 1) death certificate (ICD-9 code 250), 2) self-report of diabetes requiring pharmacological treatment, or 3) health care facility stay with diabetes discharge code. Multivariable logistic regression models assessed incident diabetes odds across increasing levels of periodontal index in comparison with periodontally healthy participants.
The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for incident diabetes in periodontal index categories 1 and 2 were not elevated, whereas the ORs in periodontal index categories 3 through 5 were 2.26 (95% CI 1.56-3.27), 1.71 (1.0-2.69), and 1.50 (0.99-2.27), respectively. The OR in edentulous participants was 1.30 (1.00-1.70). Dentate participants with advanced tooth loss had an OR of 1.70 (P < 0.05) relative to those with minimal tooth loss.
Baseline periodontal disease is an independent predictor of incident diabetes in the nationally representative sample of NHANES I.",0
"Several epidemiological studies have suggested periodontitis as a risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD), but results have been inconsistent.
We evaluated the association between clinical and radiographic measures of periodontitis, edentulism, and incident CHD (angina, myocardial infarction, or fatal CHD) among 1203 men in the VA Normative Aging and Dental Longitudinal Studies who were followed up with triennial comprehensive medical and dental examinations up to 35 years (median 24 years). Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying effects of exposure and potential confounders were fit. We found a significant dose-dependent association between periodontitis and CHD incidence among men < 60 years of age (hazard ratio 2.12, 95% confidence interval 1.26 to 3.60 comparing highest versus lowest category of radiographic bone loss, P for trend=0.02), independent of age, body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, diabetes mellitus, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, education, marital status, income, and occupation. No association was found among men > 60 years of age. Similar results were found when the sum of probing pocket depths was used as a measure of periodontitis. Among men > or = 60 years of age, edentulous men tended to have a higher risk of CHD than dentate men in the lowest bone loss (hazard ratio 1.61, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 2.73) and lowest pocket depth (hazard ratio 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 2.85) categories, independent of confounders.
Chronic periodontitis is associated with incidence of CHD among younger men, independent of established cardiovascular risk factors.",0
"This study aimed to assess the influence of systemic and local bone and intra-oral factors on the occurrence of early TiUnite implant failures.
A total of 283 consecutive patients (187 females; mean age 56.2), who received a total of 720 TiUnite implants, at the Department of Periodontology of the University Hospital of the Catholic University of Leuven, were prospectively followed. The following aspects were particularly assessed: hypertension, cardiac problems, gastric problems, osteoporosis, hypo- or hyperthyroid, hypercholesterolaemia, asthma, diabetes types I or II, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, chemotherapy, hysterectomy and intake of medication (antidepressants, steroids, hormone replacement), radiotherapy of the concerned area, breach of sterility during surgery, implant parameters, bone (quality, quantity, dehiscence or perforation), type of edentulism, antibiotics prescription, fenestration of the implant in the sinus/nasal cavity, immediate implant placement, apical lesion detection and insertion torque.
A global failure rate of 1.9% was recorded. Owing to the very few failures, no definitive conclusion concerning statistical significance can be achieved. However, a tendency for more failures was noticed for apical lesions, vicinity with natural dentition, smoking, hormone replacement, gastric problems, Crohn's disease, diabetes I and radical hysterectomy.",0
"Hypertension, also called a 'silent killer,' is one of the most common medical problems seen in our profession. A prospective study was conducted in the Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology to determine the incidence of the appearance of nutrient canals in the periapical radiographs of the mandibular anterior region of patients with high blood pressure. A total of 100 patients, between 10-80 years, were examined. After taking a proper history, systemic and oral examinations were done and the findings were recorded under two categories, hypertensive patients and normotensive patients. They were further subdivided according to their periodontal status. Intraoral periapical radiographs of the lower anterior region were then taken. Radiographs were interpreted with a good X-ray viewer and the use of a magnifying glass. Findings were recorded on a prepared format.",0
"The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the influence of systemic and local bone and intra-oral factors on the occurrence of early implant failures, i.e. up to the abutment connection.
The surgical records of 2004 consecutive patients from the total patient population who had been treated in the period 1982-2003 (with a total of 6946 Brånemark system implants) at the Department of Periodontology of the Catholic University Leuven were evaluated. For each patient the medical history was carefully checked. Data collection and analysis mainly focused on endogenous factors such as hypertension, coagulation problems, osteoporosis, hypo-hyperthyroidy, chemotherapy, diabetes type I or II, Crohn's disease, some local factors [e.g. bone quality and quantity, implant (length, diameter, location), type of edentulism, Periotest value at implant insertion, radiotherapy], smoking habits and breach of sterility during surgery.
A global failure rate of 3.6% was recorded. Osteoporosis, Crohn's disease, smoking habits, implant (length, diameter and location) and vicinity with the natural dentition were all significantly associated with early implant failures (p<0.05).
The indication for the use of oral implants should sometimes be reconsidered when alternative prosthetic treatments are available in the presence of possibly interfering systemic or local factors.",0
"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of periodontitis on development of overt nephropathy, defined as macroalbuminuria, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in type 2 diabetes.
Individuals residing in the Gila River Indian Community aged > or =25 years with type 2 diabetes, one or more periodontal examination, estimated glomerular filtration rate > or =60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), and no macroalbuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio > or =300 mg/g) were identified. Periodontitis was classified as none/mild, moderate, severe, or edentulous using number of teeth and alveolar bone score. Subjects were followed to development of macroalbuminuria or ESRD, defined as onset of renal replacement therapy or death attributed to diabetic nephropathy.
Of the 529 individuals, 107 (20%) had none/mild periodontitis, 200 (38%) had moderate periodontitis, 117 (22%) had severe periodontitis, and 105 (20%) were edentulous at baseline. During follow-up of up to 22 years, 193 individuals developed macroalbuminuria and 68 developed ESRD. Age- and sex-adjusted incidence of macroalbuminuria and ESRD increased with severity of periodontitis. After adjustment for age, sex, diabetes duration, BMI, and smoking in a proportional hazards model, the incidences of macroalbuminuria were 2.0, 2.1, and 2.6 times as high in individuals with moderate or severe periodontitis or those who were edentulous, respectively, compared with those with none/mild periodontitis (P = 0.01). Incidences of ESRD in individuals with moderate or severe periodontitis or in those who were edentulous were 2.3, 3.5, and 4.9 times as high, respectively, compared with those with none/mild periodontitis (P = 0.02).
Periodontitis predicts development of overt nephropathy and ESRD in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Whether treatment of periodontitis will reduce the risk of diabetic kidney disease remains to be determined.",0
"An accurate assessment of dental needs is important to public health planners. With this information, it is possible to assess future treatment needs and demands for services including those for removable dentures. The present work aimed to estimate the magnitude and types of needs, and demands for partial or complete removable dentures, to study some factors that may affect the identified needs and demands for removable dentures, in addition to studying the factors that may affect satisfaction with the dentures. The present study was conducted in ""Alexandria Dental Research Center"". Data were collected by means of interview questionnaire, followed by dental examination of all patients attending the center for the sake of removable dental restorations for a period of 6 months. A further follow up over a period of three months was undertaken to the 330 cases recorded. About one third of the cases demanded partial and/or complete dentures and were above 60 years old. The first purpose for construction of new dentures was mastication, followed by cosmetics. Only one quarter of cases decided to have delayed immediate dentures. Diabetics and those having chronic diseases showed more demand for complete dentures. The most discriminating variable between the demand for different dentures was the missing in the lower anterior teeth followed by missing in the upper both anterior and posterior and then missing in the upper anterior teeth. Satisfaction score increased with advance of age, among males, among those for complete dentures, and those who had had previous dentures. Stepwise logistic regression revealed that the best predictor for overall satisfaction was the history of having previous dentures. Results of the present study, suggest that early screening and treatment of diabetic patients, gathering detailed information by means of a questionnaire before new dentures fabrication may be an important tool for the dentist in predicting and consequently enhancing patient satisfaction with the dentures. Health education should stress on the value of restoring missing teeth and all available options around this.",0
"The aim of this study was to verify the prevalence of peri-implant disease and analyse possible risk variables associated with peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis. The study group consisted of 212 partially edentulous subjects rehabilitated with osseointegrated implants.
The implants placed were examined clinically and radiographically to assess the peri-implant status. The degree of association between peri-implant disease and various independent variables was investigated using a multinomial regression analysis.
The prevalence of peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis were 64.6% and 8.9%, respectively. In univariate modelling, healthy peri-implant subjects presented lower plaque scores, less periodontal bleeding on probing, and less time elapsed since placement of supra-structures. In multivariate analyses, the risk variables associated with increased odds for having peri-implant disease included: gender, plaque scores, and periodontal bleeding on probing. Presence of periodontitis and diabetes were statistically associated with increased risk of peri-implantitis. The only two factors, which did not contribute to the presence of the disease, were the time elapsed since placement of supra-structures and the frequency of visits for maintenance care.
Our data suggest that subjects with periodontitis, diabetes, and poor oral hygiene were more prone to develop peri-implantitis.",0
"The objective of this study was to determine whether an association existed between chronic systemic diseases/conditions, risk factors common in old age, and the extent and severity of chronic periodontal disease.
Sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics were examined by contrasting rural, urban-marginal, and urban social environments in Central Mexico. Data were analysed with Analysis of Variance, chi2 tests, and multivariable logistic regression.
A total of 473 adults 60 years old and over were interviewed; 315 were also examined and underwent laboratory assays (participation rate, 66%); women, 62%; mean age 73+/-8 years; 23% edentulous. The distribution of periodontitis by sociodemographic variables showed differences across locales (73% low-urban, 57% middle-urban, 29% rural). The regression model indicated that periodontitis was more frequently associated with low-urban locale, higher systolic blood pressure, higher body mass index, and worse calculus readings, with an interaction whereby being obese and having a high calculus index was associated with a high probability of having periodontitis.
Overall periodontal conditions were fair. While we identified oral, systemic, and social variables that modulated the experience of periodontitis, it would appear that urban, low social class elders appeared to have worse periodontal conditions.",0
"The purpose of this study was to examine the association between tooth loss and heart disease.
Data were analyzed from the 1999 to 2002 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, an ongoing telephone survey operated by state health agencies with assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study was conducted based on 41,891 adults aged 40 to 79 years old in 22 states and the District of Columbia.
A significant association was observed between the extent of tooth loss and heart disease prevalence. After adjustment for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and marital status, respondents who had 1 to 5 missing teeth, 6 to 31 missing teeth, or were edentulous were significantly more likely than those without tooth loss to have heart disease (adjusted prevalence: 6.8%, 10.2%, and 11.5%, respectively, vs. 5.3%; p<0.001). These associations persisted after further adjustment for smoking status, diabetes, alcohol consumption, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and body mass index (5.7%, 7.5%, and 8.5%, respectively, vs. 4.7%; p<0.05); and after stratification by age group (40 to 59 years and 60 to 79 years) and smoking status (ever smoked and never smoked).
Tooth loss is associated in a consistent and graded fashion with the self-reported prevalence of heart disease. Health promotion counseling should include the prevention and control of cardiovascular disease risk factors and the maintenance of good oral health.",0
"Over the last few decades, oral diseases including periodontitis, have been discussed as a possible risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this study was to compare the oral health of age-matched women with or without coronary heart disease (CHD).
A total of 143 consecutive women, aged 43 to 79 years, with diagnosed CHD underwent a thorough dental examination including a panoramic radiograph and were compared to 50 women, aged 45 to 77 years without CHD.
The number of remaining teeth and pathological periodontal pockets (> or =4 mm) between the groups differed. The women with CHD had 18.9 +/- 8.5 remaining teeth versus 23.4 +/- 6.3 teeth in the control group (P < 0.001). The CHD group had more pathological periodontal pockets compared to the controls, 14.2 +/- 12.4 versus 9.6 +/- 13.3 (P = 0.002), respectively. The mean marginal bone level assessed on radiographs was the same in both groups, while the number of vertical bone defects differed (P = 0.022). Dentures were more frequent in the CHD group than in the controls (27% versus 6%, P = 0.022), as was edentulousness, 10.5% versus 0% (P = 0.017), respectively. Multiple regression analysis adjusted for age, smoking, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, education, and place of birth showed a relation between the number of periodontal pockets and CHD with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.8 (1.68 to 8.74), and a tendency between dentures and CHD, with an OR of 4.6 (0.99 to 21.28).
This study indicates that women with CHD have worse oral health than those in a comparable group with no history of CHD.",0
"Chronic periodontitis (CP) is associated with stroke and subclinical atherosclerosis, but clinical measurement of CP can be time consuming and invasive. The purpose of this study was to determine whether radiographically assessed CP is associated with nonstenotic carotid artery plaque as an ultrasound measure of subclinical atherosclerosis.
Panoramic oral radiographs were obtained from 203 stroke-free subjects ages 54 to 94 during the baseline examination of the Oral Infections and Vascular Disease Epidemiology Study (INVEST). CP exposure among dentate subjects was defined either categorically (periodontal bone loss > or =50% [severe] versus <50% bone loss) or via tertile formation (for dose-response investigation), with edentulous subjects categorized separately. In all subjects, high-resolution B-mode carotid ultrasound was performed. Carotid plaque thickness (CPT) and prevalence (present/absent) were recorded. Covariates included age, sex, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
Among dentate subjects with severe periodontal bone loss, mean CPT was significantly greater (1.20+/-1.00 mm versus 0.73+/-0.89 mm; P=0.003). CPT increased with more severe bone loss (upper versus lower tertile bone loss; P=0.049; adjusted for age, sex, and hypertension). This apparent dose-response effect was more evident among never-smokers. In a fully adjusted multivariate logistic regression model, severe periodontal bone loss was associated with a nearly 4-fold increase in risk for the presence of carotid artery plaque (adjusted odds ratio, 3.64; CI, 1.37 to 9.65).
Severe periodontal bone loss is associated independently with carotid atherosclerosis. Panoramic oral radiographs may thus provide an efficient means to assess CP in studies of atherosclerosis risk.",0
"The vast majority of the U.S. adult population suffers from periodontal diseases, as about 90% suffer from the reversible form, gingivitis, whereas almost 50% of adults age ≥30 years are affected by periodontitis, which is the chronic periodontal breakdown of both soft and hard tissues that support the teeth. Diabetes prevalence is assuming epidemic proportions with 30.2 million or 12.2% of the U.S. adult population age ≥18 years having diabetes in 2015, of whom about one-quarter are unaware of their diabetes; an additional one-third (84.1 million) have prediabetes, of whom about 90% are unaware. Due to the great prevalence of both diseases, it is important for health care professionals and lay people alike to be aware of both periodontal diseases and diabetes and their two-way interactions in which they mutually and adversely affect each other to understand how to prevent, treat, and manage both diseases. Since periodontitis and diabetes share the same risk factors, any improvement in a risk factor should beneficially affect both conditions. This concept is shown by a decrease in the level of inflammation upon nonsurgical periodontal treatment, which improves both periodontal health in individuals with type 2 diabetes and those without diabetes, as well as glycemic control in type 2 diabetes and in people with prediabetes. Gingivitis is a reversible inflammation of the soft tissues surrounding the teeth in response to dental plaque, whereas periodontitis is a chronic, inflammatory disease that in response to dental plaque causes breakdown of the soft and hard tissues surrounding the teeth in susceptible individuals. This destruction often occurs without any pain or other symptoms. Nonetheless, if left untreated, it can lead to loosening of the tooth and eventually to its total loss, with adverse effects on nutrition, self-esteem, and function. Moreover, the number of teeth lost is strongly associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and advanced tooth loss, especially edentulism (loss of all teeth), is associated with premature all-cause mortality. Periodontitis causes local and systemic inflammatory responses that lead to development or worsening of hyperglycemia and hence contribute to increased blood glucose levels in healthy individuals; development of prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes; decreased glycemic control in overt diabetes; and worsening of diabetes complications. Diabetes is also a chronic, inflammation-related metabolic disease diagnosed by hyperglycemia. Such elevated blood glucose levels negatively impact the inflammatory response to dental plaque, leading to more severe gingivitis and periodontitis. Hence, periodontitis and diabetes mutually and adversely affect each other. Importantly, the risk factors are largely identical for these two diseases, so when identifying and improving risk factors related to one of the two diseases, the other could be present and its severity lessened. Such improvements could consist of quitting smoking, decreasing intake of added sugar, reducing any inflammation, and getting sufficient sleep at healthy times per the circadian rhythm. Routine, nonsurgical, periodontal treatment (“deep cleaning”) that can be performed by dental health care professionals in general dental practice or in periodontists’ specialty offices—together with proper home oral hygiene care—can lead to improved glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Hyperglycemia can also contribute to impaired healing of lesions around the apex (tip) of the teeth with chronic infection and inflammation persisting in the jaw bone. Extraction of teeth that suffer from chronic periodontitis or periapical periodontitis leads to decreased levels of inflammatory biomarkers. Moreover, diabetes and the use of diabetes medication can lead to dry mouth, which contributes to development of caries, periodontitis, and thrush (candidiasis). Diabetic neuropathy can lead to burning mouth syndrome (glossodynia) and taste impairment (dysgeusia) and may be involved in trigeminal nerve pain and temporomandibular joint disorders. Both periodontitis and diabetes lead to potentially severely diminished quality of life. Nonetheless, people with diabetes have fewer dental visits than their peers without diabetes. It is important for both dental and medical care providers to keep in mind the possible coexistence of periodontitis and dysglycemia (hyperglycemia), as both diseases negatively affect each other. Proper, mutual referral is essential, as both diseases can be improved, if the informed providers collaborate in a patient-centered, interprofessional team approach in the interest of the best possible oral and systemic health for their mutual patients. Therefore, it may make both medical and financial sense to include the attainment of a healthy mouth in diabetes management, as well as screening for diabetes in the dental office, with the potential for substantial decreases in the burden of both human disease and suffering, as well as financial costs, to the benefit of the individuals, their caregivers, and society overall.",0
"To describe life-style correlates of tooth loss in a representative rural American population.
Information on tooth loss as well as past medical history and life-style factors was obtained in a well-defined cohort of 2,764 persons 53-96 years of age in Beaver Dam, WI (1998-2000).
There were 1,992 (68.2%) persons missing some and 447 (15.3%) missing all of their teeth. In univariable analyses, age, cigarette smoking, heavy drinking, education, multivitamin use, and diabetes status were associated with tooth loss. Tooth loss was associated with poorer self-rated health and with difficulty eating solid food and inability to enjoy some food. In multivariable models age, education, smoking, heavy drinking, and diabetes were significantly associated with tooth loss.
Tooth loss is common in older persons and is associated with many risk factors including education, smoking, and heavy drinking. It is possible that modifying these may influence risk of tooth loss.",0
"Fabricating dentures for the patient with severe mandibular atrophy can be a challenge for both the dentist and patient. Subperiosteal implants with a mandibular overdenture may be a solution for the atrophic mandible.
The purpose of this retrospective study was to review the survival of mandibular subperiosteal implants placed at the University of Missouri Kansas City (UMKC) School of Dentistry Graduate Prosthodontics program between 1982 and 2000.
Forty subperiosteal implants were placed in atrophic mandibles of 40 patients (33 women, 7 men) between 1982 and 2000. The age range of the patients was 47 to 80 years of age at time of placement (mean=62 years). Each patient was reviewed clinically by an author (DJM). Manual depression and lifting of the framework were used to evaluate the stability of the implant. Additionally, the implants were observed for any movement. Each patient was questioned for pain or discomfort. Each patient was examined for observable inflammation and intraoral exposure of the framework and questioned as to whether the implant had satisfied the patient and met the patient's expectations.
Thirty-nine of the 40 original patients were recalled in 2000. One patient had died. Fourteen patients had implants for over 10 years, 12 patients had implants between 5 and 10 years, and 12 patients had implants for less than 5 years (mean time of implant service=8 years). Thirty-eight patients had the implant in place with no sign of inflammation or mobility, 1 patient with diabetes had inflammation around one of the struts. All patients were wearing their prostheses, and there was no sign of exposed implant framework for any patient. All patients reported a high level of satisfaction with the implant.
Within the limitations of this study, the mandibular implants placed at UMKC were still functioning, and all patients denied any discomfort or pain from the prostheses. Patients reported they were comfortable and able to function with the implant-supported prosthesis.",0
"To describe oral health in the Anangu Pitjantjatjaraku lands in South Australia and to compare with earlier surveys and national data.
Descriptive.
Data were collected at the time of dental care service provision, according to World Health Organization protocols, at the request of the Nganampa Health Council on optical mark reader forms.
There were 356 Anangu adults and 317 children surveyed.
The mean number of teeth affected by dental caries in the deciduous dentition in young children, aged 5-6 years, was double (mean 3.20) that of the overall Australian child population aged 5-6 years (mean 1.44). In contrast to the decline in deciduous caries in Australian children generally, Anangu children aged 5-9 years had a 42% increase in the mean number of teeth affected since 1987. Adults experienced low levels of dental caries, but severe periodontal disease was more prevalent among diabetics (79%) compared with-non-diabetics (13.8%). Tooth loss was found more frequently among adults with diabetes (mean 5.51) than non-diabetics (mean 1.53).
Oral health promotion strategies, in association with general health strategies, need to be developed to improve oral health in this remote Aboriginal population.",0
"This study evaluated whether oral disorders were associated with chronic systemic diseases in 532 Canadian adults who are old and very old and living in institutions. A brief oral examination documented tooth retention, caries, and periodontal and gingival health. Medical records provided information about chronic systemic conditions. A history of stroke was associated with a higher experience of caries, a higher ratio of decayed-to-present teeth, and more gingival and periodontal problems. Participants with high blood pressure, osteoporosis, or diabetes were more likely to be edentulous or to have fewer teeth than participants who did not have these conditions. Participants who had arthritis retained more teeth with age. Participants who had more diseases also tended to have poorer gingival or periodontal conditions, fewer teeth, and higher risk of edentulousness. The associations between systemic diseases and more severe oral disorders may be direct or may be mediated by underlying factors such as health behaviors.",0
"We investigated the relationship between periodontitis and mortality in home-dwelling individuals aged (75+ years), considering potential confounders including C-reactive protein levels. This study involved 364 individuals, originally part of the Helsinki Ageing Study cohort, who underwent medical and dental examinations in 1990 and were followed for five years. After five years, 52 of the 175 dentate subjects had died. Using univariate analysis, the association between baseline periodontitis and mortality was of borderline significance. After controlling for the common risk factors, periodontitis more than doubled the risk of cardiovascular disease-related mortality (HR 2.28, CI 1.03-5.05). The increase in total mortality was, however, not statistically significant (HR 1.43, CI 0.81-2.50). Subjects who were edentulous had higher mortality than those who were dentate without periodontitis, but the difference was not statistically significant. A baseline CRP level above 3 mg/l was associated with high mortality; but this effect was significant only among individuals with periodontitis. These results suggest that periodontitis influences the pathogenesis and outcome of cardiovascular disease, especially in individuals who also have evidence of a systemic inflammatory reaction.",0
"The aim of this study was to evaluate associations among the dental status, socioeconomic factors, and general health of 1,877 subjects between the ages of 55 and 79.
Socioeconomic information (age, sex, education level) and questions on smoking and alcohol abuse were taken from an interview; income and medical information (number of diseases) were taken from a self-administered questionnaire; and HbA1C and CDT (diabetes and alcoholism markers) were taken from blood analyses.
Of the subjects, 73% had a low education level, and 27% of the subjects had a monthly income of < 1,000 Euro and 13% of > 2,000 Euro. Twenty-six percent of the subjects were edentulous, and 29% had 20 or more teeth. The odds ratio of edentulism increased to 9.0 (95% confidence interval = 7.0-11.5) at the ages of 75 to 79 years compared to ages 55 to 79. Logistic regression analyses showed that edentulism was significantly associated with age, low education level, low income, smoking, and alcohol abuse. However, the retention of more than 20 teeth was associated with age.
Age, low income, low education level, smoking, and alcohol abuse seemed to be risk markers for edentulism; whereas, the number of diseases, diabetes, and gender were not.",0
"Several earlier studies have suggested that development of coronary heart disease (CHD) is causally related to oral infections. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between oral health indicators and CHD deaths. Out of a nationally representative sample, 6527 men and women aged 30-69 years participated in the health examination with a dental check. Detailed oral health data included caries, periodontal and dental plaque status, presence of remaining teeth, and various types of dentures. Over a mean 12-year follow-up, persons dying of CHD were older and more often smoked, had hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and only a basic education compared with other persons. In univariate analyses, several oral health indicators were associated with CHD deaths. Adjustment for the established CHD risk factors reduced all these associations to statistical non-significance. The associations between oral health indicators and CHD are mostly explained by confounding factors, particularly those relating to health behavior.",0
"Dental clinicians are confronted with an increasing number of medically compromised patients who require implant surgery for their oral rehabilitation. However, there are few guidelines on dental implant therapy in this patient category, so that numerous issues regarding pre- and post-operative management remain unclear to the dental clinician. Therefore, the aim of the present review is to offer a critical evaluation of the literature and to provide the clinician with scientifically based data for implant therapy in the medically compromised patient. This review presents the current knowledge regarding the influence of the most common systemic and local diseases on the outcome of dental implant therapy, e.g., abnormalities in bone metabolism, diabetes mellitus, xerostomia, and ectodermal dysplasias. Specific pathophysiologic aspects of the above-mentioned diseases as well as their potential implications for implant success are critically appraised. In line with these implications, guidelines for pre- and post-operative management that may assist in the successful implant-supported rehabilitation of this patient category are proposed.",0
"An increased risk for periodontitis has been associated both with type-1 or insulin dependent diabetes (IDDM) and with type-2 or non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM).
1) To describe and analyze periodontal conditions in older low-income ethnic diverse subjects with or without a diagnosis of diabetes. 2) To assess to what extent diabetes mellitus is associated with periodontal status, and 3) how periodontitis ranks as a coexisting disease among other diseases in subjects with diabetes mellitus.
Radiographic signs of alveolar bone loss were studied in 1101 older subjects 60-75 years old (mean age 67.6, SD+/-4.7). The number of periodontal sites and the proportions of teeth with probing depth (PD) > or =5 mm, clinical attachment levels (CAL) > or =4 mm were studied in a subset of 701 of the subjects.
IDDM was reported by 2.9% and NIDDM by 9.2% of the subjects. The number of remaining teeth did not differ by diabetic status. The number of sites with PD > or =5 mm and the proportion of PD with > or =5 mm was significantly smaller in the non-diabetic group (chi2=46.8, p<0.01, and chi2=171.1, p<0.001, respectively). Statistical analysis failed to demonstrate group differences for the number and proportions of sites with CAL > or =4 mm and for radiographic findings of alveolar bone loss. Combining all periodontal parameters revealed that the Mantel-Haenszel common odds of having IDDM/NIDDM and periodontitis was 1.8 : 1 (95% CI: 1.1-3.1, p<0.03). The common odds ratio estimate of an association between heart disease and diabetes was 3.6 : 1 (95% CI: 2.1-2.6, p<0.001).
Probing depth differences between IDDM/NIDDM vs. non-diabetic subjects may reflect the presences of pseudo-pockets and not progressive periodontitis in many subjects with diabetes mellitus. Periodontitis is not a predominant coexisting disease in older subjects with diabetes mellitus.",0
"The purpose of the present study was twofold: (1) to investigate how many diabetic patients and types of cases that are treated with dental implants in our clinic; and (2) assess the outcome of such treatment. Medical records from 782 patients were examined in patients treated by the Brånemark method for partial or total edentulism with implant supported bridges. From these records, 25 patients (3.2%) with diabetes before implant treatment (136 implants) were identified and further studied with respect to age, gender, type of diabetes, treated jaw, degree of edentulism, bone graft, implant survival, periimplant inflammation, bleeding on probing, and radiographic bone loss. Furthermore, the patients' opinion about the outcome of the treatment was registered. The implant success rate was 96.3% during the healing period and 94.1% 1 year after surgery. Of all 38 bridges, one was lost. Few complications occurred and all patients, except for one, were satisfied with the treatment. Today, diabetic patients are being treated successfully for all types of edentulism, including bone-grafting treatment. Diabetics that undergo dental implant treatment do not encounter a higher failure rate than the normal population, if the diabetics' plasma glucose level is normal or close to normal as assessed by personal interviews.",0
"One in 3 adults in the United States has periodontitis, yet there are few widely applied methods for its prevention. Few studies have assessed oral hygiene practices related to periodontitis.
There were 533 participants in this study (14.8% male dentists; 13.7% male non-dentist health care professionals; and 71.5% female nurses), all of whom are enrolled in ongoing cohort studies in the United States which have inquired about their oral hygiene practices and whether they have professionally diagnosed periodontitis. We studied the relationship between oral hygiene practices and periodontitis, controlling for potential confounders.
The participants were 69 years old on average, 84.2% white, 12.4% current smokers, and 8.3% diabetic. Seventy percent of the dentists and nurses brushed at least twice a day compared to 56% of the other health professionals. Two-thirds of the nurses, 56.3% dentists, and 36.4% other health professionals flossed at least once daily. Persons brushing twice daily were as likely to have periodontitis as those brushing once or less daily (odds ratio [OR] = 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64 to 2.10); persons flossing less than once a day were as likely to have periodontitis as those who flossed daily (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 0.63 to 2.13) after controlling for profession, age, gender, smoking, diabetes, coronary heart disease, history of periodontal surgery, and number of teeth present.
People who reported better oral hygiene practices did not report less periodontitis, after controlling for potential confounders. Oral hygiene practices were not associated with periodontitis in this population.",0
"The importance of maintenance and promotion of periodontal health is emphasized among people with diabetes because of their high risk for periodontal diseases. Our aim was to evaluate oral health behavior and its determinants among adults with diabetes in Finland.
The population of the questionnaire study consisted of 420 systematically selected adults with diabetes, who were members of a national diabetes register. The response rate was 80%. Questions focused on self-treatment, -prevention, and -diagnosis of oral diseases, utilization of dental services, and knowledge and attitudes toward oral health among adult people with diabetes. Oral self-care was evaluated in the framework of the New Century model of oral health promotion.
The proportion of edentulous subjects was 23%, and these were excluded from further analysis. Self-reported twice-a-day brushing among dentate participants was significantly more common among women and the highly educated, but was less common compared with earlier studies among Finnish adults. A quarter of those surveyed reported never cleaning interdental surfaces, with the number of daily cleaners being nearly equal (27%). Age 40 years or over and recent treatment by a private dentist were significant predictors for daily interdental cleaning. The proportion of those who had attended a dental appointment within the last year was 63%, and the main reason for the last dental visit was an emergency among almost one-fifth of those surveyed.
A need exists for further promotion of oral self-care among adults with diabetes. Support by dental and other health care professionals involved in diabetes care should be encouraged.",0
"Associations between dental diseases and systemic outcomes are potentially important because of the high occurrence of dental diseases. If this extremely common source of chronic infection (dental disease) leads to an increased morbidity and mortality rate, the public health impact of oral disease on millions of Americans would be substantial. Recent studies demonstrate an association between dental and systemic diseases, including systemic infections, cardiovascular disease, pregnancy outcomes, respiratory diseases, and increased all-cause mortality rate. Because there are several common risk factors for oral and systemic diseases, and limitations in published studies, a careful interpretation is needed. Confounding (shared risk factors for both systemic and dental disease) may explain part of the reported associations. It is also plausible that there may be a causal link. It is likely that if there is a causal link, several pathways and mediators coexist, linking oral and systemic disease. Bacteremia, bacterial endotoxins, cytokines, and other inflammatory mediators could conceivably be playing a direct or indirect role. Missing teeth are a surrogate marker for previous dental infection, and may also lead to altered dietary intake. Hence, diet may be an additional mediator for several of these outcomes. We caution clinicians not to recommend extracting infected teeth, based on the periodontal-systemic disease associations, if the teeth do not warrant extraction otherwise, because loss of teeth and edentulousness are associated with increased risk of systemic diseases. When assessed against causal-defined criteria, the evidence suggests possible causal associations between chronic periodontal disease and tooth loss with cardiovascular disease, bacterial endocarditis, pregnancy outcomes, and all-cause overall mortality. Further studies are needed to show consistency, to corroborate that the associations are independent of common risk factors for both systemic and dental disease, including healthy lifestyle factors, and to evaluate different biological pathways.",0
"A series of prospective studies started in the mid-1980s at the University of Toronto have provided evidence of the efficacy and effectiveness of implants in the treatment of the fully and partially edentulous patients. These studies have focused primarily on treatment outcomes at the surgical and prosthodontic levels, with an overall failure rate of 7.7% over a 20-year period. Because a considerable proportion of these failures (4.2%) occurred before insertion of the prosthesis, and because osseointegration is essentially a wound-healing process, factors that interfere with healing, including systemic conditions, may contribute to implant failure. This paper reviews studies on the impact of selected systemic conditions, including osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism, as well as smoking behaviour, on the success or survival of oral implants in patients treated in the Implant Prosthodontic Unit at the University of Toronto.",0
"The goal of this study was to provide data relative to the use of a new implant system (Mac System, Cabon, Milan, Italy) with a Morse taper implant-abutment connection for single implant restorations. The implant system is composed of an endosseous screw made of commercially pure titanium grade 2, while the abutment is titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V). A total of 80 single implants were placed in 69 patients (36 women and 33 men, mean age 42 years, range 16 to 61). All patients gave their informed consent and received a thorough clinical and radiographic examination. Smokers and diabetics were excluded from the study. Three implants were placed in areas of previous tooth impaction, 5 were placed in posttraumatic edentulous areas, 2 were used in situations involving tooth agenesis, and 60 replaced teeth lost because of caries or periodontal disease. All patients were edentulous for at least 1 year prior to treatment. The implants received a definitive prosthesis and had been in function for a mean period of 3.5 years. At second-stage surgery, 2 implants were removed because of lack of osseointegration. After 2 years of loading, 1 implant showed evidence of peri-implantitis and was removed. In addition, 2 fractured abutments and 1 loosened abutment were observed. Few mechanical or infectious complications were seen, and this may have been the result of high stability of the conical connection.",0
"Dental diseases are widespread and are often underrecognized and treated. Caries and periodontal disease are common dental conditions that cause the majority of tooth loss. Although these conditions are preventable, many persons do not receive regular dental care and have acute problems when seen by their physician. Dental diseases frequently affect patients with multiple systemic disorders, including autoimmune disorders, diabetes, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The presence of dental disease may trigger inflammatory responses and have systemic consequences. Since dental disease affects almost all individuals, physicians should be able to recognize common conditions such as caries, periodontal disease, pulpitis, and dental abscess. In addition to initiating treatment and appropriate dental referrals, physicians should be familiar with the management of antibiotics and medications in the perioperative period. Another important role for physicians is to help reduce the societal and economic impact of these diseases through patient education and prevention.",0
"The oral health of a large cohort of adult insulin-dependent diabetic patients (Type 1), diagnosed 24 years previously with juvenile onset, was comprehensively assessed. This paper describes the prevalence of coronal and root caries in this adult Type 1 diabetic population and evaluates demographic, dietary, behavioral, physiologic, salivary and medical variables associated with decayed and filled surfaces in the crown (DFS) or root (RDFS).
Type 1 diabetes mellitus subjects participating in this oral health evaluation had been monitored for 6-8 years as participants in the University of Pittsburgh, Department of Epidemiology, longitudinal study of medical complications associated with diabetes. Four hundred and six diabetic subjects received a comprehensive oral health examination during one of their regularly scheduled medical visits. Oral assessments included coronal and root caries, missing teeth, edentulism, periodontal status, soft tissue pathologies, salivary function and health behaviors. Sixteen diabetic subjects and one control subject were edentulous. Coronal and root caries data from the remaining 390 dentate diabetic subjects were compared with 202 dentate nondiabetic control subjects.
The adult Type 1 diabetic subjects were not found to have significantly higher DFS rates as compared with our control subjects or published age-adjusted NHANES III findings. Both control and diabetic subjects had low decayed to filled tooth surface ratios. A linear regression model evaluated possible associations with coronal decayed and filled tooth surfaces (DFS) within the diabetic population. Significant factors included older age, women, fewer missing teeth, more frequent use of dental floss, more frequent visits to the dentist during the last 12 months, and diabetic nephropathy. The prevalence of RDFS was higher in the diabetic subjects as compared to recruited control subjects. Neither dietary behaviors nor glycemic control were found to contribute to coronal or root caries.
Factors associated with presence of coronal and root caries and fillings are discussed. Possible causes and implications for the association between DFS and diabetic nephropathy are provided.",0
"To investigate the importance of medical and dental factors in aspiration pneumonia in an older veteran population.
Prospective enrollment of subjects with retrospective analysis of data.
Department of Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic, inpatient ward, and nursing home.
358 veterans age 55 and older; 50 subjects with aspiration pneumonia.
Demographic and medical data; functional status; health-related behaviors; dental care utilization; personal oral hygiene; comprehensive dental examination; salivary assays including IgA antibodies; and cultures of saliva, throat, and dental plaques.
Two logistic regression models produced estimates of significant risk factors. One model using dentate patients included: requiring help with feeding (odds ratio (OR) = 13.9), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR = 4.7), diabetes mellitus (OR = 3.5), number of decayed teeth (OR = 1.2), number of functional dental units (OR = 1.2), presence of important organisms for decay, Streptococcus sobrinus in saliva (OR = 6.2), and periodontal disease, Porphyromonous gingivalis in dental plaque (OR = 4.2), and Staphylococcus aureus presence in saliva (OR = 7.4). The second model, containing both dentate and edentulous patients included: requiring help with feeding (OR = 4.7), COPD (OR = 2.5), diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.7), and presence of S. aureus in saliva (OR = 8.3).
This study supports the significance of oral and dental factors while controlling for established medical risk factors in aspiration pneumonia incidence.",0
"To describe the prevalence of tooth loss, to examine risk factors for having fewer teeth or no teeth, and to describe the use of dental services in an older Mexican-American population.
Data from the baseline phase of the Hispanic Established Population for the Epidemiological Study of the Elderly survey conducted from 1993 to 1994, a cross-sectional survey of older Mexican Americans.
Five southwestern states: Texas, California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado.
3,050 noninstitutionalized Mexican Americans age 65 to 99.
Twenty-seven percent of the sample was completely edentulous and 22% reported visiting or speaking with a dental care professional in the preceding year. Logistic regression analyses showed that being older or being female was significantly associated with tooth loss, adjusting for education, income, smoking status, and diabetes mellitus. Current smokers (odds ratio (OR) = 1.69; 95% CI = 1.31-2.20) and diabetics (OR = 1.53; 95% CI = 1.27-1.84) were more at risk for tooth loss, as were persons of lower socioeconomic status.
The prevalence of tooth loss and use of dental services in this population of older Mexican Americans is lower than what has been previously found among older people in the general population.",0
"Masticatory performance results from a complex interplay of direct and indirect effects, yet most studies employ univariate models. This study tested a multivariate model of masticatory performance for dentate subjects. Explanatory variables included number of functional tooth units, bite force, sex, age, masseter cross-sectional area, presence of temporomandibular disorders, and presence of diabetes mellitus. The population-based sample consisted of 631 dentate subjects aged 37-80 years. Covariance structure analysis showed that 68% of the variability in masticatory performance could be explained by the combined effects of the explanatory variables. Age and sex did not show a strong effect on masticatory performance, either directly or indirectly through masseter cross-sectional area, temporomandibular disorders, and bite force. Number of functional tooth units and bite force were confirmed as the key determinants of masticatory performance, which suggests that their maintenance may be of major importance for promoting healthful functional status.",0
"An increasing number of studies point to the detrimental effect of plaque bacteria on periimplant tissue health. The purpose of this retrospective study was to explore a possible relationship between the clinical and microbiological periimplant conditions of osseointegrated oral implants after several years of service and the dental and medical history, as well as the conditions of the residual dentition. 45 partially edentulous patients (mean age: 51 years, range: 27-83 years), with a total of 64 implants participated in this retrospective analysis. The time between examination and the last dental visit ranged from 6 to 24 months (mean: 13 months) and the time since the last maintenance therapy appointment with a dental hygienist ranged between 3 and 24 months (mean 7 months). During 5 to 10 years between implant installation and examination, 9 implants experienced one episode and an additional 6 implants two episodes of periimplantitis. As a consequence of extensive bone loss associated with these infections, one of these implants, in a patient who had a history of diabetes, was lost. With this exception, the other episodes of periimplantitis were successfully treated employing the principles of the Cumulative Interceptive Supportive Therapy (CIST) protocol. At examination, 42 implants (66%) showed a probing pocket depth exceeding 4 mm. Of the periimplantitis sites, four implants showed cultural evidence for presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, and 2 implants were positive for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Statistical analysis revealed a significant relationship between periimplant probing depth and the total anaerobic cultivable microbiota as well as the frequency of detection of P. gingivalis.",0
"This article reports results of the 1991 Indian Health Service Patient Oral Health Survey in the areas of tooth loss and need for tooth extraction.
The survey examined a sample of American Indian and Alaska Native dental patients. Tooth loss and need for tooth extraction are explored for a total of 12,349 individuals aged 18 years and older.
Complete tooth loss in patients aged 35 years and older was 11 percent; in patients aged 65 years and older, it was 42 percent. The mean number of remaining teeth in dentate patients aged 35 years and older was 20.7; the mean number of remaining teeth decreased in each older age group. Partial and complete tooth loss were more severe in diabetic patients. In 35- to 44-year-old patients, only 20 percent had not lost at least one permanent tooth. The prevalence of tooth loss differs by geographic region. The percentage of dental patients with 20 or more teeth increased between 1984 and 1991.
Tooth loss remains a substantial problem in American Indian and Alaska Native adult dental patients. This article presents results of an Indian Health Service (IHS) oral health survey conducted in 1991 of the American Indian and Alaska Native (Native American) population with respect to tooth loss. Limited comparisons of tooth loss observed in the 1991 patient survey are made to the 1984 patient survey.",0
"This paper reviews the demographics, access to care barriers, and the oral health of American Indian and Alaska Native (Native American) elders aged 65 years and older using complete tooth loss as a measure to compare with the US population. Strategies for improving oral health and increasing access to care for Native American elders also are discussed.
We reviewed the results from patient surveys conducted by the Indian Health Service (1983-84 and 1991) and data from other sources, including the second International Collaborative Study of Oral Health Outcomes (ICS-II) conducted in 1990 on the Sioux and Navajo reservations. We compared complete tooth loss data from these studies with findings of the 1985 National Institute of Dental Research Oral Health Survey of US Employed Adults and Seniors and the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).
The 1991 Indian Health Service (IHS) patient survey reported a complete tooth loss prevalence of 42 percent among elders. Although it is based on a patient sample, this finding is comparable to the rate of 40 percent found among a random sample of Navajo and Lakota adults aged 65-74 years reported in the ICS-II study. The 1991 IHS patient survey also found complete tooth loss among diabetics to be much higher than among nondiabetics.
The prevalence of complete tooth loss for Native American elders is higher than in population surveys of US elders based on random samples. The actual prevalence of complete tooth loss is probably even higher in Native American elders because estimates presented in this paper are clinic based.",0
"It is unclear whether the replacement of conventional mandibular dentures with implant-supported overdentures alters the diet and thus improves the nutritional intake of edentulous persons.
The purpose of this study was to compare the pretreatment and posttreatment diets of edentulous diabetic patients who received new dentures with either a conventional complete mandibular denture (CD) or a mandibular implant-supported overdenture (IOD).
New dentures were made for 89 edentulous diabetic patients with acceptable metabolic control without insulin (NIT) or with insulin (IT). A randomized approach was used to assign 37 patients a mandibular CD and 52 patients a mandibular IOD supported by 2 cylindrical implants. Of the 89 patients, 58 submitted a dietary log for 7 consecutive days before treatment (PT) and 6 months after treatment completion (PTC). An average daily intake of 28 essential nutrients was determined for each patient at each time interval. Separate 2 x 2 x 2 repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were performed for each nutrient to compare the means of the 2 denture groups (CD and IOD), 2 diabetic groups (NIT and IT), and 2 time intervals (PT and PTC). The intakes were also compared with the recommended daily allowance (RDA).
ANOVAs for all 28 nutritional variables showed no main effect for either denture type or diabetic treatment. Time effects were seen for magnesium, potassium, copper, and monounsaturated fats. The PTC mean intake of the total sample (N = 58) decreased for all 3 minerals and increased for monounsaturated fats with study dentures. Post hoc tests showed the differences between PT and PTC means to be statistically significant for only magnesium (P=.043) and potassium (P=.015). The percentage of patients with PT intake 25% or more below the RDA ranged from 33% to 85% in the CD group and from 24% to 100% in the IOD group for the same 11 nutrients. PTC fiber intake deficiency was noted in almost all participants. Carbohydrate consumption was markedly lower than that recommended by the American Diabetic Association.
As is often the case with elderly groups, this group of edentulous diabetic patients showed highly comprised nutritional intakes of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. The replacement of old dentures with new dentures that included either a mandibular CD or IOD did not alter patient diets such that the patients improved their nutritional intakes of essential micronutrients and macronutrients.",0
"Diabetes mellitus, a prevalent disorder worldwide, is associated with systemic adverse sequelae, such as wound healing alterations, which may affect osseointegration of dental implants. This prospective multicenter study assessed the success of 2-stage endosseous root-form implants (3 different implant systems) placed in the mandibular symphysis of 89 male type 2 diabetic subjects. The implants were uncovered approximately 4 months after placement, restored with an implant-supported, Hader bar clip-retained overdenture, and maintained at scheduled follow-up data collection examinations for 60 months after loading. Sixteen (9.0%) of the 178 implants failed. Life table methods calculated implant survival at approximately 88%, from prosthesis placement through the 60-month follow-up, and at approximately 90% from implant placement through the observation period. No implants failed between surgical placement and uncovering, 5 failed at uncovering, 7 failed after uncovering before prosthesis placement, and 4 failed after prosthesis placement. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values were determined before implant placement (baseline) and approximately 4 months later at surgical uncovering (follow-up). The 5-year implant outcomes (successes versus failures) were analyzed against the following predictor variables: (1) baseline and follow-up FPG values, (2) baseline and follow-up HbA1c values, (3) subject age, (4) duration of diabetes (years), (5) baseline diabetic therapy, (6) smoking history, and (7) implant length. Regression analysis found only duration of diabetes (P < .025) and implant length (P < .001) to be statistically significant predictors of implant failure. There was no statistically significant difference in failure rates between the 3 different implant systems used. This study supports the use of dental implants in type 2 diabetic patients.",0
"Moderate elevation of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease among apparently healthy individuals, although factors that create this inflammatory response in the absence of systemic illness have not been clarified. This study aimed to: (1) evaluate associations among periodontal disease, established risk factors for elevated CRP, and CRP levels within the US population; and (2) determine whether total tooth loss is associated with reduced CRP. Data were obtained from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A random sample of the US population was interviewed in their homes and examined at mobile examination centers. CRP was quantified from peripheral blood samples and analyzed as a continuous variable and as the prevalence of elevated CRP (> or = 10 mg/L). Some 12,949 people aged 18+ years who had periodontal examinations and an additional 1,817 edentulous people aged 18+ years were included in the analysis. Dentate people with extensive periodontal disease (> 10% of sites with periodontal pockets 4+ mm) had an increase of approximately one-third in mean CRP and a doubling in prevalence of elevated CRP compared with periodontally healthy people. Raised CRP levels among people with extensive periodontal disease persisted in multivariate analyses (P < 0.01), with established risk factors for elevated CRP (diabetes, arthritis, emphysema, smoking, and anti-inflammatory medications) and sociodemographic factors controlled for. However, CRP levels were similarly raised in edentulous people. Furthermore, the established risk factors for elevated CRP modified relationships between oral status and CRP levels. Periodontal disease and edentulism were associated with systemic inflammatory response in the US population, most notably among people who had no established risk factors for elevated CRP.",0
"The risks of infective endocarditis (IE) associated with various conditions and procedures are poorly defined.
This was a population-based case-control study conducted in 54 Philadelphia, Pa-area hospitals from 1988 to 1990. Community-acquired IE cases unassociated with intravenous drug use were compared with matched community residents. Subjects were interviewed for risk factors. Diagnoses were confirmed by expert review of medical record abstracts with risk factor data removed. Cases were more likely than controls to suffer from prior severe kidney disease (adjusted OR [95% CI]=16.9 [1.5 to 193], P:=0.02) and diabetes mellitus (adjusted OR [95% CI]=2.7 [1.4 to 5.2], P:=0.004). Cases infected with skin flora had received intravenous fluids more often (adjusted OR [95% CI]=6.7 [1.1 to 41], P:=0.04) and had more often had a previous skin infection (adjusted OR [95% CI]=3.5 [0.7 to 17], P:=0.11). No association was seen with pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiac, or genitourinary procedures or with surgery. Edentulous patients had a lower risk of IE from dental flora than patients who had teeth but did not floss. Daily flossing was associated with a borderline decreased IE risk.
Within the limits of the available sample size, the data showed that IE patients differ from people without IE with regard to certain important risk factors but not regarding recent procedures.",0
"As patients become edentulous, dental implants have been one treatment alternative. Although studies indicate that dental implants inserted in healthy patients have been successful, their placement in the diabetic patient remains controversial. The purpose of this study utilizing histometric parameters compares the course of osseous healing around endosseous implants in normal non-diabetic and insulin controlled diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Blood glucose was monitored by the glucose-oxidase method and controlled with daily insulin injections. Sterile custom fabricated commercially pure solid cylinder titanium implants, with a titanium plasma-sprayed surface were placed in the femora of each animal. The results indicate that insulin therapy was able to upregulate the formation of bone around implants inserted in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model. However, histometric parameters utilized indicated that although the total quantity of bone formation was greater in the insulin controlled group, there was significantly less bone-to-implant contact in the insulin controlled diabetic group as compared to normal non-diabetic controls.",0
"Little is known about factors influencing the spread of blepharospasm to other body parts. An investigation was carried out to deterrmine whether demographic features (sex, age at blepharospasm onset), putative risk, or protective factors for blepharospasm (family history of dystonia or tremor, previous head or face trauma with loss of consciousness, ocular diseases, and cigarette smoking), age related diseases (diabetes, hypertension), edentulousness, and neck or trunk trauma preceding the onset of blepharospasm could distinguish patients with blepharospasm who had spread of dystonia from those who did not.
159 outpatients presenting initially with blepharospasm were selected in 16 Italian Institutions. There were 104 patients with focal blepharospasm (mean duration of disease 5.3 (SD 1.9) years) and 55 patients in whom segmental or multifocal dystonia developed (mainly in the cranial cervical area) 1.5 (1.2) years after the onset of blepharospasm. Information was obtained from a standardised questionnaire administered by medical interviewers. A Cox regression model was used to examine the relation between the investigated variables and spread.
Previous head or face trauma with loss of consciousness, age at the onset of blepharospasm, and female sex were independently associated with an increased risk of spread. A significant association was not found between spread of dystonia and previous ocular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, neck or trunk trauma, edentulousness, cigarette smoking, and family history of dystonia or tremor. An unsatisfactory study power negatively influenced the validity and accuracy of the negative findings relative to diabetes, neck or trunk trauma, and cigarette smoking.
The results of this exploratory study confirm that patients presenting initially with blepharospasm are most likely to experience some spread of dystonia within a few years of the onset of blepharospasm and suggest that head or face trauma with loss of consciousness preceding the onset, age at onset, and female sex may be relevant to spread. The suggested association between edentulousness and cranial cervical dystonia may be apparent because of the confounding effect of both age at onset and head or face trauma with loss of consciousness. The lack of influence of family history of dystonia on spread is consistent with previous findings indicating that the inheritance pattern is the same for focal and segmental blepharospasm.",0
"There is insufficient evidence to indicate the functional superiority of mandibular implant-supported overdentures to justify their use in edentulous patients.
This study compared the benefits perceived by patients who received a new maxillary denture and a mandibular conventional denture (CD) and an implant-supported overdenture (IOD).
New maxillary and mandibular dentures were delivered to 89 diabetic denture wearers with clinically acceptable metabolic control who treated their diabetes either with insulin (IT) or without insulin (NIT). Of the 89 patients, 37 received maxillary and mandibular CDs and 52 received a maxillary CD and an IOD. Two questionnaires with categorical responses were used; the first contained 13 questions to ascertain a patient's absolute assessments of original dentures at entry and study dentures at 6- and 24-months after treatment completion; the second questionnaire had 11 questions that assessed the relative change perceived by patients with study dentures. Of the 78 patients who completed the posttreatment (PT) assessments at 6 months, 68 patients provided longitudinal data for questionnaire I and cross-sectional data for questionnaire II. In addition, 46 patients (18 CD and 28 IOD) also provided PT assessments at 24 months.
Both mean scores and percentage distributions of longitudinal data for questionnaire I showed perceptual improvements with both types of study dentures. Improvements were higher in the IOD than in the CD group. Mean scores failed to show any significant differences between the 2 treatment groups. The only significant difference was found in the change in percentage distributions for perceptual chewing ability in favor of the IOD group. Even this advantage was lost at 24 months. With the comparative questionnaire, a higher percentage of patients in the IOD group than in the CD group perceived improvements with study dentures from their original dentures in chewing ability, chewing comfort, and denture security. However, mean differences were statistically significant in favor of the IOD group only for chewing ability and less difficulty to chew hard foods.
The mandibular implant-supported overdenture offers same advantage in terms of perceived chewing function over the conventional denture.",0
"To examine the association of edentulousness with systemic factors: age, gender, tobacco-smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, functioning in daily living, cortical thickness at the mandibular angle, and systemic diseases: bone-fracture (an indicator for osteoporosis), diabetes, thyroid disease, hyperparathyroidism, asthma, heart failure, hypertension.
The study population comprised 293 elderly subjects, 124 (42%) edentulous and 169 (58%) dentate. The data from clinical and radiographic examinations and structured interviews were analyzed by multiple logistic regression.
When edentulousness in both the mandible and the maxilla was considered, history of bone fracture and tobacco-smoking were significantly related to complete edentulousness with odds ratios (OR) of 2.51 (95% CI: 1.47-4.28) and 2.42 (95% CI: 1.32-4.43) respectively, associations independent of age and gender. A similar association was found for the edentulous mandible. In the elderly subjects with an edentulous maxilla, besides the significant factors of history of bone fracture and tobacco-smoking, asthma was also associated with edentulousness at an odds ratio of 10.81 (95% CI: 1.38-84.66), oldest subjects most often being edentulous (OR: 2.23, 95% CI: 1.13-4.39). Diabetes was not related to edentulousness either in the mandible or in the maxilla.
The finding of associations of history of bone fracture, tobacco-smoking, and asthma with edentulousness emphasizes the association of systemic conditions with edentulousness. Advanced age was related to an edentulous maxilla. The relationship between asthma and total tooth loss in the maxilla might suggest a local oral effect of medications used by asthmatic patients.",0
"A study was done on geriatric residents from three institutions in Metro Manila namely La Verna I and II, a retirement home of Sisters of Franciscan Immaculate Concepcion; Hospicio de San Jose, a catholic welfare institution for the very young as well as for the very old; and Golden Acres, a government institution that takes care of indigent old/elderly people. A total of 176 geriatric residents were examined, majority are from Golden Acres with 121, followed by Hospicio de San Jose with 30 and lastly La Verna I and II with 25. In general, the oral health status of geriatric residents is very poor especially at Golden Acres and Hospicio de San Jose. Since all the resident sisters in La Verna I and II are highly educated, their oral health status is fair to good. The more prevalent medical problems the geriatric residents had are: Cataract (54); Hypertension/Cardiac Disorders (46); Rheumatoid Arthritis (30); Respiratory Diseases (29); Blood Diseases (28); Diabetes Mellitus (14); Skin Diseases (10); Impaired Hearing (13); Neurologic Problems (19); and Psychological Problems (2).",0
"Recent reports have implicated periodontal disease as a risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD).
A retrospective cohort study was conducted using participants in the 1970-1972 Nutrition Canada Survey (NCS). The mortality experience of male and female NCS participants aged 35-84 years without self-reported CHD (n = 10,368) or cerebrovascular disease (CVD) (n = 11,251) was determined through 1993. The relation between dental health and the risk of fatal CHD and CVD was assessed using Poisson regression modeling.
In total, 466 CHD and 210 CVD deaths were observed; missing confounder data reduced these numbers to 416 CHD and 182 CVD deaths. Adjusted for age, sex, diabetes status, serum total cholesterol, smoking, hypertensive status, and province, we found a statistically significant association between periodontal disease and risk of fatal CHD. Rate ratios (RR) of 2.15 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-3.72) and 1.90 (95% CI 1.17-3.10) were observed for severe gingivitis and edentulous status, respectively. Non-statistically significantly increased RRs of 1.81 and 1.63 were observed for severe gingivitis and edentulous status for CVD.
These data indicate that poor dental health is associated with an increased risk of fatal CHD.",0
"The oral health of an adult population previously diagnosed with juvenile onset insulin dependent-diabetes was comprehensively assessed. The goal of this exploratory cross-sectional evaluation was to described the characteristics related to partial tooth loss edentulism in subjects with Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
An adult population of 406 Type 1 diabetes mellitus subjects, who had been monitored for 6-8 years as part of a University of Pittsburgh longitudinal study of medical complications associated with diabetes, received an oral health examination for missing teeth, edentulism, coronal and root caries, periodontal status, and oral health behaviors.
Of the 406 subjects evaluated, 204 had no missing teeth, 186 had partial tooth loss (1-27 missing teeth), and 16 were edentulous. Patients who had partial tooth loss or who were edentulous were generally older; had lower incomes and levels of education; and had higher rates of nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, and peripheral vascular disease. A logistic regression model found partial tooth loss to be significantly associated with extensive periodontal disease in remaining teeth (OR = 7.35), a duration of diabetes longer than 24 years (OR = 5.32), not using dental floss (OR = 2.37), diabetic neuropathy (OR = 2.29), household income less than $20,000 (OR = 2.21), multiple coronal caries and fillings (OR = 1.98), and bleeding on probing (OR = 1.82).
Although the majority of these adult Type 1 diabetes patients had serious medical complications associated with their diabetes, the possible impact of diabetes mellitus on oral health should be included in their overall management.",0
"Convincing evidence is lacking to demonstrate the functional superiority of mandibular implant-supported overdentures over conventional dentures.
This randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare masticatory functional effectiveness of mandibular implant-supported overdentures and conventional dentures in diabetic denture wearers with clinically acceptable metabolic control.
A total of 102 edentulous diabetic patients, treated with or without insulin, were randomized to receive a new maxillary and either a mandibular conventional denture or an implant-supported overdenture. Treatment was completed in 89 patients, 37 with conventional dentures and 52 with Hader bar-clip attachment overdentures supported by two IMZ implants. Besides data from medical and dental histories, oromaxillofacial examinations, and questionnaires, masticatory tests were performed by patients before and at 6 and 24 months after treatment completion. Although 78 patients (28 in the conventional, 50 in the overdenture group) performed tests at 6 months after treatment, 68 (25 in the conventional, 43 in the overdenture) had performance data for both entry and 6-month posttreatment intervals.
The two treatment groups were highly comparable in terms of general characteristics, quality of original dentures, tissue support, and past denture experience. No significant differences were found between patients treated for diabetes with or without insulin. All four masticatory performance scores with original dentures were higher in the conventional denture group than the overdenture group. The posttreatment performance scores for the two treatment groups became similar because of the higher gains in the overdenture group. Patients with low initial performance scores showed greater posttreatment gains with both conventional dentures and overdentures.
The implant-supported overdenture showed no significant advantage over the conventional denture for improving the ability to comminute food in this group of diabetic patients with higher than average initial functional levels observed for other groups of denture wearers in previous studies.",0
"Scientific evidence is lacking to support the general application of implant-supported mandibular overdentures.
This randomized clinical trial was undertaken to compare the efficacy of conventional mandibular and implant-supported overdentures in diabetic edentulous patients with clinically acceptable metabolic control.
A total of 102 diabetic patients, treated with or without insulin, were randomized to receive a new maxillary denture and either a conventional or an implant-supported removable mandibular overdenture. Treatment was completed for 89 patients, 37 with the conventional and 52 with implant-supported dentures. Detailed examinations, tests, and questionnaires were given before and at 6- and 24-months after treatment completion. Comparisons between the two treatment groups were made for treatment failures based on prespecifed criteria and the type and amount of maintenance care provided.
The insulin and noninsulin treated groups were collapsed because of the lack of significant differences at entry. The conventional denture and implant-supported overdenture groups were similar in terms of general demographics, medical status, quality of their original dentures and denture support, several functional measures, and patient satisfaction. Treatment was judged to be successful in 56.9% of patients with conventional dentures and 72.1% with overdentures. This difference in success rate was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Patients with treatment failures in both groups required excessive maintenance care. Those with conventional dentures needed frequent denture base adjustments and relines, whereas those with overdentures required frequent clip replacements and repairs. Although significant improvements were seen with both treatment modalities, a higher percentage of patients with implant-supported overdentures than those with conventional dentures reported improvements in chewing comfort and moderate-to-complete overall satisfaction.",0
"The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of general health and life-style factors on the number of remaining teeth in 68-year-old men living in the city of Malmö, Sweden. The study included 483 men (participation rate, 78%). Poor self-assessed health, frequent medical attendance, diabetes, and oral dryness were related to fewer remaining teeth. Number of teeth was negatively correlated to concentrations of triglycerides and alkaline phosphatases in serum and to glucose in blood but positively correlated to serum urea. Various dietary variables including consumption of sucrose-containing products and nutritional quality were not related either to number of teeth or to prevalence of edentulousness. Smoking and high consumption of coffee or alcohol were associated with fewer remaining teeth. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that social class, frequency of dental attendance, smoking, and serum concentrations of triglycerides and urea had an independent effect on number of teeth.",0
"To assess the association between a measure of extensive tooth loss (functional edentulism) and obesity with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in a racially heterogeneous sample.
A cross-sectional survey (370 subjects) was performed by reviewing the medical and dental records of dependently or independently living individuals who were treated as inpatients and/or outpatients at a Department of Veterans Affairs facility. Frequencies and descriptive measures were derived; univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to test for associations, confounding, effect modification, and interaction using functional edentulism and obesity as the independent variables and NIDDM as the dependent measure.
Functionally edentulous individuals were at significantly greater risk for NIDDM (estimated odds ratio [OR] = 4.06), than the obese (OR = 3.29). These relationships were not confounded by age or race in this sample. Obesity did confound functional edentulism in the multivariable model, suggesting that they act independently on the outcome variable (NIDDM).
Dentist-assessed functional edentulism and physician-diagnosed obesity were significantly associated with NIDDM in this sample of predominantly older men. This finding ought to be considered by primary care providers in formulating dietary strategies in order to facilitate the realization of their therapeutic goals.",0
"In order to evaluate general and local contraindications for implantation for 65-yr-old subjects from a medium-sized Finnish city, 431 such persons were examined anamnestically and by means of panoramic radiographs. The population represents 61% of the total age group in the city (born in 1923). It was shown that several degrees of cardiac problems and increased blood pressure followed by pulmonary diseases and diabetes were the most commonly encountered relative contraindications for implantation. Eleven percent of the patients said that they smoked regularly and the bone quality was estimated to be less suitable for implantation in 21% of the cases. Implantation was evaluated according to the Bonefit system (implant lengths between 6 and 16 mm) in 10 regions in the maxilla and 6 regions in the mandible and was shown to be possible in 38% of the regions in the partially edentulous maxillae and 50% of those in the partially edentulous mandibles, the corresponding figures for the edentulous jaws were 55% in the maxilla and 61% in the mandible.",0
"This study examined parotid salivary flow rate and composition in three groups of differently treated diabetics and a control group of non-diabetics. The study population was composed of edentulous African-Americans at least 65 years of age. Group A was the control, Group B insulin-dependent (Regular Iletin, U-100 qd.), Group C controlled by oral medication (Tolbutamide, 500 mg qd.), and Group D was diet controlled. All diabetic patients had serum glucose values under 250 mg/dl. Salivary flow rates, secretory IgA, electrolytes (Na+, Cl-, K+, Ca++) and total protein concentrations were evaluated. The results showed no significant differences between groups with respect to salivary flow rates, electrolytes and IgA concentrations. Additionally, all diabetic groups demonstrated a significantly lower salivary total protein concentration when compared to the controls. There appears to be no evident decrease in salivary flow rate in these three differently controlled diabetic groups compared with healthy non-diabetics.",0
"The NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) of 1982-84 collected longitudinal data from 10,523 individuals initially seen during the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) of 1971-75. Among this additional data was information on the incidence of total tooth loss during the 10 years between the surveys, which could then be added to NHANES I data to identify risk factors. In this analysis, a series of bivariate analyses were carried out, followed by logistic regression analysis to assess the simultaneous effect of major variables. Results showed that 7.4 percent of dentate Americans aged 25-74 at NHANES I became edentulous over the next 10 years. In bivariate analyses, the incidence of edentulism was correlated with baseline measures of lower income and education status, poorer oral health, self-perceptions of poor general health and oral health, absence of a regular dentist, and a lower number of remaining teeth at baseline. No correlation was found with gender and geographic region, nor with self-reported diabetes and arthritis, and age was not a factor when the number of remaining teeth at baseline were taken into account. In a logistic regression model assessing the effect of these variables simultaneously, none of the demographic variables retained significance; the only variable statistically significant in both age groups was the number of teeth remaining at baseline. Other significant variables in younger persons were higher periodontal disease scores, perceived poor dental health, perceived need for extractions, history of smoking, and low ascorbic acid intake. Some of these variables were reflections of negative health behavior and attitudes rather than direct correlates. Principal findings from this study were the importance of early tooth loss in eventual edentulism and the virtual disappearance of gender and age as determinants of total tooth loss.",0
"Hormonal control of skeletal growth, modeling, and remodeling is characterized by a complex interaction between the calciotropic hormones (25-hydroxycholecalciferol, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, parathyroid hormone, and calcitonin), growth, and thyroid hormones in addition to the estrogenic and androgenic gonadal hormones. Although both growth and thyroid hormones are essential skeletal growth and modeling and also can produce detrimental skeletal effects in adults when circulating in excess concentrations, these hormones assume a minor role in the day-to-day bone remodeling of the mature skeleton. Following the attainment of the peak bone mass, bone mineral content begins to decline in the fourth and fifth decades of life, accelerating in females in the first 5-7 years after the menopause as a result of estrogen deficiency. Associated with this age-dependent loss in skeletal mass are decreases in calcitonin reserve primarily in the 5-7 years following the menopause, decreases in circulating 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, intestinal resistance to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, and a gradual progressive rise in blood parathyroid hormone. These changes in calciotropic hormone profiles, together with poor nutritional habits, anticonvulsant, glucocorticoid, and thyroid medications, diseases such as type I diabetes, immobilization, or decreased physical activity all serve to weaken the aging skeleton. The result is a gradual and subtle change in skeletal anatomy, which progresses to alterations in vertebral structure, such as kyphosis, scoliosis, and pseudospondylolisthesis, and a variety of sciatic and nerve entrapment syndromes. Vertebral, forearm, and hip fractures and edentulism ultimately comprise the syndrome of age-related bone loss, resulting in lifestyle disabilities, extensive morbidity, analgesic drug abuse, hospitalization, and escalating annual health care expenditures.",0
"The objective of this study was to assess the level of root caries in a population of diabetic adults. Diabetics are of special interest because they are alleged to be periodontally compromised and have atypical patterns of refined carbohydrate ingestion. Diabetic subjects were patients of the Joslin Diabetic Center in Boston and had significantly elevated blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels over at least a ten-year period. Eligible subjects had to be between the ages of 45 and 65 and have a minimum of ten teeth and three sites with recession. Data were collected on coronal caries, oral hygiene, gingivitis, pocket depth, recession, and root caries and were compared with data from control subjects from a larger non-diabetic study group. There were 88 diabetics and 185 controls with mean ages of 55.7 and 56.3 years, respectively. The groups were found to be similar with respect to the numbers of buccal surface sites with gingival recession and the numbers of carious root lesions. There was a distinct difference, however, with respect to restored root surfaces: 1.76 mean filled surfaces were observed in the controls, as compared with 0.49 in the diabetics. A Katz Root Caries Index (for which lesions are calculated as a percentage of the numbers of exposed root surfaces) was determined to be 15.2 for the controls and 7.1 for the diabetics. A reasonable inference is that these differences are the result of a restricted ingestion of refined carbohydrates by the diabetic group. This was confirmed by a dietary survey of subsamples from the diabetic and non-diabetic groups.",0
"The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of dental caries, DMFT score and treatment needs in a group of diabetic patients (n = 222), mean age 46.9 yr, and to compare them to those recorded in a control group (n = 189), mean age 43.9 yr, using WHO criteria. Relations between the type and duration of diabetes mellitus, diabetic complications (retinopathy and neuropathy), diabetic control, and the subjects' DMFT status were separately studied. The results obtained revealed no difference in the prevalence of caries between the group of diabetics and the control group. Neither was any difference found in the mean numbers of teeth with fillings, but the number of extracted teeth per subject was significantly higher in the group of diabetics (12.3) than in the control group (9.7) (P less than 0.01). Type I diabetics were found to have a significantly higher number of teeth with fillings (4.05 vs. 2.22) than the non-insulin dependent diabetics (P less than 0.001). Type II diabetics, however, had a significantly higher number of extracted teeth (14.1 vs. 10.4) (P less than 0.001). There was no difference in the caries experience regarding duration of diabetes, diabetic control, or diabetic complications.",0
"The aim of this study was to investigate dental care habits and knowledge of oral health in age- and sex-matched adult long and short duration insulin-dependent diabetics and non-diabetics. Ninety-four long and 86 short duration diabetics and 86 non-diabetics, aged 20-70 years, participated in the study. All subjects answered a questionnaire with 38 questions about dental visits, attitudes to and knowledge of dental diseases, toothcleaning, dietary and smoking habits, and oral sensations. Among the diabetics there was a rather large group that did not visit a dentist annually. The diabetics also required more emergency dental care and were not as willing as the non-diabetics to spend time and money on their teeth. The compliance with dietary advice was poor among the diabetics. Oral discomfort such as prickling and burning sensations, metallic and bad taste was rare in both diabetics and non-diabetics. In the diabetics, however, a feeling of mouth dryness was common.",0
"The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence and severity of periodontal disease in age- and sex-matched adult long- and short-duration insulin-dependent diabetics and non-diabetics. The study involved 82 subjects with long- and 72 with short-duration diabetes and 77 non-diabetics, all aged 20-70 years. The clinical and radiographic examination comprised recordings of the number of existing teeth, absence or presence of plaque and supra- and subgingival calculus, gingival conditions, probing pocket depth and alveolar bone level. There were no significant differences in the number of existing teeth or presence of plaque and supra- and subgingival calculus between long- and short-duration diabetics and non-diabetics. Diabetics, irrespective of the duration of the disease, had a higher prevalence of sites with gingivitis than non-diabetics. Overall, there were no significant differences between the groups regarding the prevalence of tooth surfaces with probing pocket depths of 4 and 5 mm. However, on comparison between age subgroups, long-duration diabetics younger than 45 years had significantly more 4 and 5 mm pockets than non-diabetics. Long-duration diabetics altogether had significantly more tooth surfaces with probing depth greater than or equal to 6 mm than non-diabetics. The radiographs of alveolar bone height exhibited significantly more extensive alveolar bone loss in long-duration diabetics aged 40-49 years than in short-duration diabetics and non-diabetics. This, together with the increased number of subjects belonging to classification groups with severe periodontal disease experience among long-duration diabetics, indicates more periodontal disease in these diabetics.",0
"The aim of this study was to investigate, using the CPITN system, the periodontal treatment needs in diabetic patients, and to shed additional light on the possible effects of the duration and control of diabetes on the periodontal status in these patients. A comparison was made between 222 diabetic patients (mean age, 46.9 years) and 189 control subjects (mean age, 43.9 years). Edentulous patients were not included in the study. The results indicated that diabetic patients demonstrated significantly more missing teeth (P less than 0.001). The mean number of missing sextants was also significantly higher in diabetics. Pathologic pockets of 6 mm or more were found in 1.3 and 0.3 sextants in the diabetic and control group subjects, respectively (P less than 0.001). Up to the age of 34, no differences were observed between the diabetic and control group subjects regarding pathologic pockets of 6 mm or more. Above this age, diabetics demonstrated significantly more sextants with deep pockets (P less than 0.001). Concerning the type of diabetes, no differences related to CPITN score were found between insulin dependent and non-insulin dependent diabetics. Neither were any differences found in the periodontal condition related to the duration and control of diabetes, whereas diabetics with advanced retinopathy demonstrated more sextants with deep pockets. Oral hygiene instructions and scaling were required in all patients from both study groups. On an average, 1.3 sextants in 50.9% of diabetics and 0.3 sextants in 17.9% of control subjects required complex treatment.",0
"One hundred and nine patients with diabetes mellitus and 100 age-, sex- and denture-status-matched, non-diabetic individuals were investigated prospectively. Comparison was made of oral candidal carriage, clinical infection and inherited ability to secrete blood group antigens in saliva. Diabetic patients had a significantly higher prevalence of oral candidal carriage and infection (P less than 0.001) than non-diabetic individuals, but the candidal load between the 2 groups, was not significant. A comparable proportion of insulin-dependent, non-insulin dependent and control groups were secretors of blood group antigens, and there was no difference in the oral candidal carriage and infection rates between secretors and non-secretors.",0
"Analysis of data from some 8,300 adults, ages 25-74, shows an inverse relationship between the probability of having a masticatory handicap and socioeconomic status: lower socioeconomic status is associated with higher probability of having a masticatory handicap. Further, adults with a masticatory handicap among the low socioeconomic group have significantly lower intakes, adjusted for age, gender, and body mass, of calories and some nutrients than the non-handicapped. In the former, there is also a higher probability of three dietary-related chronic conditions developing: hypertension, heart attack, and diabetes mellitus. A masticatory handicap appears to have little effect on nutrient intake or the development of the chronic conditions among the high socioeconomic group. The evidence suggests that masticatory handicap is an added risk factor among the low socioeconomic group for these chronic conditions.",0
"Osseo-integrated implants provide effective treatment results for edentulous. However, despite the high success and survival rates of dental implants, several factors, such as poor oral hygiene and history of periodontal disease, and systemic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, could influence the outcome of the treatment. In fact, poor glycemic control can affect the healing process. Diabetes mellitus is considered a relative contraindication for dental implant therapy due to the fact that the success rates of the implants seem to be lower in diabetic patients, even if there is no total agreement among the results reported in the literature. The analysis of peri-implant inflammation indices, bone loss around the implant and glycemic index can provide us with useful information on the relationship between glycaemia in diabetic patients and the course of peri-implantitis, as well as implant success in the short term.
The purpose of this review is to establish how peri-implant inflammation parameters vary in diabetic versus non-diabetic patients.
This review was conducted on the basis of PRISMA. The search was conducted by three independent reviewers searching for keywords in three databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web Of Sciences (WOS), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial.
a total of 1159 records were identified and 11 articles were included in the qualitative analysis.
The analysis of the extracted data from the included studies suggests that some peri-implant inflammation indices, such as bleeding on probing and bone loss around the implant, appear to be increased in diabetic patients with glycometabolic decompensation, compared with control not affected by diabetes mellitus.",1
"Mönckeberg medial calcinosis (MMC) is a potentially serious vasculopathy involving calcification of the arterial tunica media of the extremities, heart, and other viscera. There are a limited number of cases reported in the dental literature, usually associated with the facial artery. Although MMC is often discerned as an occult radiologic finding in middle-aged adults, its presence may serve as a harbinger for end-stage renal disease, diabetes, other pathologic processes, and possible regional hypoperfusion. The objective of this report is to feature an elderly patient with MMC of the facial and infraorbital arteries. In addition, a brief review of published cases of MMC and its differential diagnosis have been provided. It is recommended that affected patients be referred for a comprehensive medical assessment. Timely discovery of calcified arteries may improve patient outcomes.",1
"This systematic review aimed to evaluate complications and survival rates of dental implants placed in patients suffering from autoimmune diseases.
A systematic review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses systematic review guidelines (PRISMA), using Google scholar and PubMed electronic databases with a stop date of September 2021. The eligibility criteria included all full text human studies in the English language literature reporting on patients with autoimmune diseases treated with dental implants.
Fifty-five studies reporting on nine distinct autoimmune diseases were analyzed: 17 on Sjögren's syndrome (SS), 11 on oral lichen planus (OLP), 8 on Type 1 diabetes, 6 on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 4 on systemic scleroderma (SSc), 3 on Crohn's disease (CD), 3 on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 2 on mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMB) and 1 on pemphigus vulgaris (PV). Despite the heterogeneity and methodological limitations of most of the studies, results showed that dental implant survival rates were comparable to those reported in the general population. However, patients with secondary SS or erosive OLP were more susceptible to developing peri-mucositis and increased marginal bone loss.
This review suggested that dental implants may be considered as a safe and viable therapeutic option in the management of edentulous patients suffering from autoimmune diseases. Nevertheless, scrupulous maintenance of oral hygiene and long-term follow-up emerge as being the common determinants for uneventful dental implant treatment.",1
"This systematic review assesses the association of tooth loss (TL), as the exposure, with morbidity and mortality by diabetes mellitus (DM) status, as the outcome, in older adults.
Individuals with DM have higher prevalence of severe TL and increased risk of developing morbidities and mortality. No systematic review has evaluated the association between TL with morbidity and mortality by DM status.
Comprehensive searches used multiple publication databases containing reports published between 01/01/2000 and 04/21/2021. Two authors independently evaluated included studies for quality and risk of bias using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist for cohort and Center for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) critical appraisal sheet for cross-sectional studies, while a third author arbitrated decisions to resolve disagreements.
Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria: eight cross-sectional and five cohort. Qualitative review of the included studies indicated TL is associated with increased incidence and prevalence of DM. TL is also associated with DM-related morbidities including greater prevalence of heart disease, diabetic retinopathy, metabolic syndrome; poorer health-related quality of life; poorer survival of participants with chronic kidney disease; and increased medical expenditure. Overall, the quality of the evidence reviewed was medium, as per the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 2011 Levels of Evidence.
This review found significant associations of TL with prevalence and incidence of DM and adverse DM-related outcomes. An interprofessional team-care approach that includes an oral health component could benefit the prevention and management of DM.",1
"To evaluate the survival rate, success rate, and peri-implant biological changes of immediately loaded dental implants (ILs) placed in type 2 diabetic patients (DM2).
The present study was registered on PROSPERO and followed the PRISMA checklist. The search was performed by the first reviewer in January 2021. The electronic databases used were MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane, BVS, Web of Science, Scopus, LIVIVO, and gray literature. The risk of bias analysis was performed using an instrument from the Joanna Briggs Institute.
A total of 3566 titles and abstracts were obtained. The qualitative synthesis included 7 studies, while the quantitative synthesis included 5 studies. The meta-analysis of IL in individuals with DM2 compared to nondiabetic individuals showed no significant difference among the groups regarding the survival rate of dental implants (RR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.96-1.04; p = 0.91; I
Type 2 diabetes mellitus does not seem to be a risk factor for immediately loaded implants if the glycemic level is controlled, the oral hygiene is satisfactory, and the technical steps are strictly followed. Clinical relevance Rehabilitation in diabetic individuals is more common due to the highest prevalence of edentulism in this population. It is essential to establish appropriate protocols for loading dental implants.",1
"The main goal of this report was to solve a clinical case of a 73-year-old man with diabetes, partial edentulism and a pathological occlusion with biocorrosion using conservative and adhesive techniques. A complete rehabilitative treatment was performed, increasing the vertical dimension of occlusion using indirect restorations with composite resins on teeth and resin crowns on implants and returning function using mutually protected occlusion. A 6-month posttreatment clinical and radiographic follow-up was performed.",1
"To describe a novel surgical technique using the Boston Keratoprosthesis (KPro) type I in a patient with advanced ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP) using oral mucosa for covering the prosthesis.
We present the case of an 85-year-old man previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and advanced OCP nonresponsive to immunosuppressive treatment, whose best-corrected visual acuity was light perception and projection in both eyes. After examination, Boston KPro type I in the right eye was contemplated because osteo-odonto KPro and Tibial bone KPro were not feasible because of the patient's osteoporosis and edentulism. Reconstruction of the ocular surface was first performed using oral mucosa to release the symblepharon and try to deep the fornices. Three months later, the oral mucosa was lifted, and the Boston KPro type I was implanted using the patient's own cornea. Then, a modification of the standard surgical technique was carried out, replacing the use of contact lens for covering the prosthesis with an oral mucosa graft with a central trephination as an alternative option in fornix foreshortening cases.
After 11 months, visual acuity was stable to 0.2 decimal. No postoperative complications have been encountered, and prosthesis was in place.
The surgical technique of transmucosal Boston KPro type I may be considered a surgical alternative in patients with advanced OCP who present with severe fornix foreshortening, where osteo-odonto KPro or Tibial bone KPro cannot be performed due to osteoporosis or edentulism or when the Boston KPro type II is not readily available.",1
"Periodontal disease (PD), as a chronic bacterial infection, might cause cardiovascular and some other systemic diseases, with recent studies reporting that it exhibits some connection with lung cancer. While studies have shown that poor oral health might increase the risk of lung cancer, the veracity of these reports is questionable. Therefore, this meta-analysis was undertaken to investigate the association between PD and the risk of lung cancer. A search was run in PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases up to January 1, 2020. Cohort and case-control studies investigating the correlation between PD and lung cancer were included. Eligibility assessment and data extraction were conducted independently, and a meta-analysis was performed to synthesize the data. The association between PD, edentulism, and lung cancer was measured by the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) provided in articles. We employed appropriate effect model in terms of I",1
"Actinomycosis is an uncommon, chronic suppurative granulomatous infection and needs to be considered as a differential diagnosis. A 56-year-old woman with a background of type 2 diabetes mellitus and breast carcinoma was referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery 2-week wait clinic, regarding a tender sublingual mass and firm erythematous swelling in the right submandibular and submental region. This was slowly progressive and had not responded to oral co-amoxiclav. An orthopantomogram showed a well-defined radiolucency and smaller radiolucent lesions throughout the edentulous right body of the mandible. A contrast-enhanced CT confirmed a right submandibular abscess communicating with cavitating lesions. The differentials included osteomyelitis, bony metastases, multiple myeloma or other cystic lesions. The patient underwent incision and drainage of the abscess, alongside biopsies, and intravenous co-amoxiclav was given. Microbiology cultures confirmed the presence of ",1
"A 76-year-old man presented with neck swelling associated with pain and fever. On examination, there was a submental neck swelling. His initial CT scan showed multiloculated abscess centred in the left submandibular gland. He remained febrile despite on intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole. A repeat CT scan revealed significant worsening with multiple pockets of fluids with gas locules in the deep neck spaces. He subsequently underwent neck exploration and drainage of neck abscess. Extensive necrotic tissue was found intraoperatively and thick pus was drained from the bilateral parapharyngeal, submental spaces and anterior mediastium. Pus culture profusely grew of ",1
"Since their development, dental implants have become one of the most common procedures to rehabilitate patients with single missing teeth or fully edentulous jaws. As implants become more mainstream, determining the factors that affect osseointegration is extremely important. Medical risk factors identified to negatively affect osseointegration include diabetes and osteoporosis. However, other systemic conditions and medications that interfere with wound healing have not been as widely investigated. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of systemic disorders including diabetes and osteoporosis on implant osseointegration. The aim was also to evaluate the effect of other diseases, such as neurocognitive diseases, cardiovascular disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and antihypertensives. Although the literature does not demonstrate that diabetes negatively affects implant osseointegration, most studies focus on well-controlled diabetics and the use of prophylactic antibiotics. In addition, studies have shown increased long-term bone and soft tissue complications. For osteoporosis, recent studies and reviews also fail to demonstrate a lower osseointegration rate. However, caution must be exercised in these patients due to the risk for osteonecrosis of the jaws (ONJ), especially in patients with bone malignancies. There is also no direct evidence that patients with HIV, cardiovascular disease, neurologic disorders, hypothyroidism, or rheumatoid arthritis have a decreased rate of implant osseointegration. However, some preliminary evidence suggests that medications such as SSRIs or PPIs may have a negative effect on implant osseointegration. These studies are fairly recent and must be validated with continuous research. Moreover, disease control, concomitant medications, and other comorbidities complicate implant osseointegration and must guide our treatment approaches and clinical guidelines.",1
"The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the potential use of dental imaging assessment of trabecular bone structure in the maxillomandibular complex as an adjuvant screening tool to identify systemic disorders. Five electronic databases and grey literature were searched. Studies were included if they investigated subjects with altered trabecular bone determined by dental radiographs. The QUADAS-2 assessed the risk of bias (RoB) among the studies, while the GRADE determined the strength of evidence. A total of 14 studies that included 1,466 individuals were considered eligible for the qualitative analysis. All studies presented an overall low RoB and low concern regarding applicability. Systemic disorders such as osteoporosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, diabetes, and primary hyperparathyroidism, with their respective control groups, were analyzed among the included studies. Osteoporosis was the condition presenting the most significant results, and 72% of the studies detected changes in the maxillomandibular trabecular bone structure. Studies exploring diabetic edentulous patients found less dense trabecular bone pattern (p < 0.05). In summary, periapical and panoramic radiographs, computed tomography, and cone beam computed tomography imaging could be considered useful for the assessment of the mandibular trabecular bone structure of patients affected by osteoporosis and patients with diabetes.",1
"The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the prevalence, incidence and risk factors of peri-implantitis in the current literature. An electronic search was performed to identify publications from January 1980 until March 2016 on 9 databases. The prevalence and incidence of peri-implantitis were assessed in different subgroups of patients and the prevalences were adjusted for sample size (SSA) of studies. For 12 of 111 identified putative risk factors and risk indicators, forest plots were created. Heterogeneity analysis and random effect meta-analysis were performed for selected potential risk factors of peri-implantitis. The search retrieved 8357 potentially relevant studies. Fifty-seven studies were included in the systematic review. Overall, the prevalence of peri-implantitis on implant level ranged from 1.1% to 85.0% and the incidence from 0.4% within 3 years, to 43.9% within 5 years, respectively. The median prevalence of peri-implantitis was 9.0% (SSA 10.9%) for regular participants of a prophylaxis program, 18.8% (SSA 8.8%) for patients without regular preventive maintenance, 11.0% (SSA 7.4%) for non-smokers, 7.0% (SSA 7.0%) among patients representing the general population, 9.6% (SSA 9.6%) for patients provided with fixed partial dentures, 14.3% (SSA 9.8%) for subjects with a history of periodontitis, 26.0% (SSA 28.8%) for patients with implant function time ≥5 years and 21.2% (SSA 38.4%) for ≥10 years. On a medium and medium-high level of evidence, smoking (effect summary OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.25-2.3), diabetes mellitus (effect summary OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.4-4.5), lack of prophylaxis and history or presence of periodontitis were identified as risk factors of peri-implantitis. There is medium-high evidence that patient's age (effect summary OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.87-1.16), gender and maxillary implants are not related to peri-implantitis. Currently, there is no convincing or low evidence available that identifies osteoporosis, absence of keratinized mucosa, implant surface characteristics or edentulism as risk factors for peri-implantitis. Based on the data analyzed in this systematic review, insufficient high-quality evidence is available to the research question. Future studies of prospective, randomized and controlled type including sufficient sample sizes are needed. The application of consistent diagnostic criteria (eg, according to the latest definition by the European Workshop on Periodontology) is particularly important. Very few studies evaluated the incidence of peri-implantitis; however, this study design may contribute to examine further the potential risk factors.",1
"Periodontal disease (PD), now our commonest infectious disorder leads to tooth loss, and has been linked to various systemic diseases, including various types of cancer. The aim of this study is to provide a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the relationship between PD, edentulism, and pancreatic cancer (PC).
From an initial review of 327 references we selected eight studies concerning periodontitis or edentulism with sufficient quantitative information to allow us to examine the risk of PC. We used relative risks (RRs), hazard ratios, or odds ratios to measure the association between periodontitis, edentulism, and PC. We employed random effects models to obtain summary risks, and we also provide measures of study differences and possible biases.
The summary RR for periodontitis and PC was 1.74 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41-2.15] and 1.54 for edentulism (95% CI 1.16-2.05). There was no evidence of heterogeneity for either variable, and no evidence of publication bias. The studies included reports from three continents, suggesting that the association is generalizable. Most of the studies were adjusted for variables thought to be associated with PC, such as gender, smoking, BMI, diabetes, and alcohol.
Using meta-analysis, both periodontitis and edentulism appear to be associated with PC, even after adjusting for common risk factors. As yet, the mechanisms linking oral disease and PC are uncertain, but could be related to changes in the oral microbiome-an area of current research.",1
"Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is developed even in the patients who are edentulous and treated with short-term bisphosphonate therapy and oral administration. It sometimes causes lethal sepsis in patients who have multiple health problems such as diabetes, cirrhosis, steroid use for interstitial pneumonia, sepsis, and spinal disk herniation.",1
"To report a rare case of chronic invasive fungal rhinosinusitis with palatal erosion.
Restoring and maintaining oral health of diabetic elderly patients with increased risk of infections is a challenge to the dentist. Patients suffering from uncontrolled diabetes are susceptible to fungal infections. Palatal erosion due to fungal rhinosinusitis is rare.
Case report of a 65 years old illiterate female patient from low socio-economic strata, suffering from uncontrolled diabetes and poor systemic health presenting with chronic invasive fungal rhinosinusitis leading to palatal erosion.
Such a case is a diagnostic challenge to a dentist. Therefore understanding the disease process and its possible outcomes is desirable. The treatment warrants a multidisciplinary approach.",1
Two patient case histories are described as examples of treatment of severe periodontitis in severely compromised partial dentitions. Management consisted of periodontal treatment and telescopic crown support for removable partial dentures with friction pin retention.,1
"When atrophic jaws compromise oral rehabilitation with conventional implants, narrow-diameter implants can be used. This case report describes treatment of an edentulous 75-year-old diabetic woman with a severely resorbed mandibular ridge. Her mandibular dentition was restored with an overdenture supported by 3 narrow implants and 1 mini implant. Her maxillary dentition was restored with a conventional complete denture. A 6-year clinical and radiographic follow-up confirmed that the narrow implants had provided effective stability for the overdenture, providing improvements in phonetics and masticatory ability at a low cost.",1
"The present clinical report describes the prosthodontic management for a patient with uncontrolled bleeding and diabetes mellitus treated with a maxillary complete denture and a mandibular partial fixed dental prosthesis designed to interface with a removable cast framework partial denture retained by 2 ERA attachments. This approach was undertaken to improve both retention and stability of the distal extension Kennedy Class I removable partial denture. The rehabilitation provided better anterior esthetics than if treated with a conventional clasp retained removable partial denture, by employing a simple, practical design and offering a significant biomechanical advantages, restoring both oral health and function. Thus, this treatment modality, involving an ERA system and transfixation in fixed crowns, is an effective treatment and can be indicated as a clinical alternative for edentulous and partially edentulous patients with systemic disorders or for patients in economic situations that might preclude implant-based rehabilitation.",1
"Phytobezoars are a rare cause of intestinal obstruction. They are usually present in patients with predisposing factors such as previous gastric surgery, diabetes, and edentulousness. In this case report, an uncommon cause of intestinal obstruction due to the migration of gastric phytobezoar in a patient with no known predisposing factor is reported.",1
"Protein-energy malnutrition is associated with numerous poor health outcomes, including high health care costs, mortality rates and poor physical functioning in older adults. This systematic literature review aims to identify and provide an evidence based overview of potential determinants of protein-energy malnutrition in community-dwelling older adults. A systematic search was conducted in PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL and COCHRANE from the earliest possible date through January 2013. Observational studies that examined determinants of protein-energy malnutrition were selected and a best evidence synthesis was performed to summarize the results. In total 28 studies were included in this review from which 122 unique potential determinants were derived. Thirty-seven determinants were examined in sufficient number of studies and were included in a best evidence synthesis. The best evidence score comprised design (cross-sectional, longitudinal) and quality of the study (high, moderate) to grade the evidence level. Strong evidence for an association with protein-energy malnutrition was found for poor appetite, and moderate evidence for edentulousness, having no diabetes, hospitalization and poor self-reported health. Strong evidence for no association was found for anxiety, chewing difficulty, few friends, living alone, feeling lonely, death of spouse, high number of diseases, heart failure and coronary failure, stroke (CVA) and the use of anti-inflammatory medications. This review shows that protein-energy malnutrition is a multifactorial problem and that different domains likely play a role in the pathway of developing protein-energy malnutrition. These results provide important knowledge for the development of targeted, multifactorial interventions that aim to prevent the development of protein-energy malnutrition in community-dwelling older adults.",1
"It is difficult today to find older patients without their cleft palate prosthetically rehabilitated. This case report presents the rehabilitation by conventional dental prostheses of a cleft palate patient who had no prior treatment. A 52-year-old male presented himself to have his fissured palate obturated and occlusion restored. He reported difficulties in swallowing food and liquids, along with a severe speech disability. The patient's medical history revealed diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, low vision due to macular atrophic lesions, and xerostomia. The upper and lower arches were completely and partially edentulous, respectively. The treatment plan involved a conventional denture to be placed in the upper arch, and a removable partial denture to be placed in the lower arch.",1
"This article reports the case of a 55-year-old female patient who presented with unsatisfactory temporary crowns in the right mandibular premolars and molars, and a premolar-to-molar fixed partial denture in the left side. The clinical and radiographic examinations revealed a fracture of the left first premolar that was a retainer of the fixed partial denture and required extraction. Initially, the acrylic resin crowns were replaced by new ones, and a provisional RPD was made using acrylic resin and orthodontic wire clasps to resolve the problem arising from the loss of the fixed partial denture. Considering the patient's high esthetic demands, the treatment options for the definitive prosthetic treatment were discussed with her and rehabilitation with implant-supported dentures was proposed because the clinical conditions of the residual alveolar ridge were suitable for implant installation, and the patient's general health was excellent. However, the patient did not agree because she knew of a failed case of implant-retained denture in a diabetic individual and was concerned. The patient was fully informed that implant installation was the best indication for her case, but the arguments were not sufficient to change her decision. The treatment possibilities were presented and the patient opted for a clasp-retained removable partial denture (RPD) associated with the placement of crowns in the pillar teeth. The temporary RPD was replaced by the definitive RPD constructed subsequently. Although RPD was not the first choice, satisfactory esthetic and functional outcomes were achieved, overcoming the patient's expectations. This case report illustrates that the dentist must be prepared to deal with situations where, for reasons that cannot be managed, the patient does not accept the treatment considered as the most indicated for his/her case. Alternatives must be proposed and the functional and esthetic requirements must be fulfilled in the best possible manner.",1
"A 69-year-old woman with unexplained fever and weakness was referred for evaluation of a solitary mandibular swelling adjacent to a severely resorbed edentulous mandibular ridge. The patient had coexisting craniofacial-skeletal lesions and diabetes insipidus. Histological and immunohistochemical staining of sections from mandibular lesions confirmed the rare diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester disease. The absence of cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and major neurological manifestations was suggestive of a diagnosis at an early stage of the disease. Early diagnosis has been rare with less than 100 reported cases. A review of the literature revealed only 2 cases that report detailed maxillomandibular radiographic findings. A seemingly benign clinical presentation of a potentially grave disease that presents with an osteolytic-sclerotic oral radiographic picture is reported.",1
